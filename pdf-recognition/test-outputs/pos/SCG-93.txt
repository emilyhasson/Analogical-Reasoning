Fellow Shareholders:
I am pleased to provide you with the 1993
Annual Report for SCANA Corporation, which reflects
the most successful year in the Company's 147-
year history. This success is attributable in part to
purposeful changes in the Company initiated over
the past several years as well as to the efforts of
highly skilled and dedicated employees. I am excit-
ed to be able to outline the progress that has been
made and hope you will get a sense of the momen-
tum we are building.
Earnings for 1993 were $3.72 per common
share, a significant increase over the $2.84 per
share reported for the previous year. In 1992 earn-
ings were reduced from $3.11 to $2.84 per share
as a result of a nonrecurring, cumulative electric rate
refund stemming from a South Carolina Supreme
Court decision. Thus a better comparison from con-
tinuing operations shows an increase in 1993 eam-
ings per share of 20%, despite a 9% increase in
the average number of common shares outstand-
ing. The specific reasons for the increase in eam-
ings are explained in some detail elsewhere in the
report. However, it is worth noting that earnings from
our natural gas exploration and production compa-
ny contributed $.25 per share in 1993, up $.20 per
share from 1992. This is a relatively new business
for SCANA Corporation and reflects the growth
potential available to us as we continue to seek and
focus on opportunities in energy-related businesses
beyond our traditional electric and natural gas utility
businesses.
The indicated annual dividend rate was raised
2.9% effective April 1, 1994 to $2.82 per common
share. The magnitude of the increase reflects the
fundamental progress of our businesses in sales
and earings. SCANA Corporation has increased its
dividend 19 years in a row, and 41 of the last 42
years.
Record cold weather in January 1994 placed
substantial demands on each of SCANA's energy
subsidiaries. All were more than equal to the task.
New records were set for electric energy sales and
we had a new winter peak demand for the system.
All generating plants performed well, and we experi-
enced no voltage reductions or rotating blackouts as
was the case with several other companies. Peak
demand and total sales of natural gas to residential
and commercial customers also set records. Our
natural gas pipeline system, including the two lique-
fied natural gas storage facilities, worked flawlessly.
Despite supply limitations, the pipeline company
and propane company managed inventories and
flowing supplies to keep energy available to indus-
tries which were without an alternate fuel source,
thereby allowing them to continue operations. In ret-
rospect, it was our employees' dedication, compe-
tence and "can do" attitude, together with the wis-
dom of our supply strategies and some very long
work days, which enabled our customers to have
the energy they needed during the crisis.
Construction continues significantly ahead of
schedule and on budget for our new Cope Electric
Generating Station, with commercial operation
scheduled for early 1996. With supply shortages of
electricity occurring on many systems affected by
the recent cold weather, I am pleased that we have
this additional 385 megawatts of baseload capaci-
ty under construction in order to meet our cus-
tomers' future needs.
In addition to the outstanding operating perfor-
mance mentioned above, South Carolina Electric &
Gas Company continued its preparations for a less
regulated, more competitive business environment.
Through the formation of strategic business units
and completion of organizational effectiveness
reviews, SCE&G has become more decentralized
operationally and more focused on its various cus-
tomers. Despite an overall electric rate increase of
7.4% which went into effect June 1, 1993, our
electric rates are among the lowest in the Southeast,
and we enjoy a significant competitive price advan-
tage over our neighboring regulated utilities and
most electric cooperatives.
In January 1994 we settled the litigation with
Westinghouse Electric Corporation concerning the
steam generators it furnished for our V. C. Summer
Nuclear Station. As I previously reported, these gen-
erators have experienced unusual wear and mainte-
nance requirements which made it necessary for us
to replace them with new equipment. While the
terms of the settlement were sealed by the court, I
am satisfied that the result will provide substantialbenefits to our cus-
torners without the
expense and risk of a
trial. New generators
will be installed dur-
ing a refueling outage
scheduled for the
fourth quarter of 1994.
In January 1994
the Supreme Court of
South Carolina issued
a decision which
upholds prior rulings
of the state's Public
Service Commission
that permit industrial
interruptible natural
gas sales to be regu-
lated on the basis of
"value of service*
rather than a strict cost of service. This ruling is very
important in that it affirms a 30-year practice of our
natural gas companies to negotiate sales prices
directly with industrial customers which can use
alternate fuels in price competition with natural gas.
This very progressive ruling takes on added signifi-
cance when viewed in light of the increasing dereg-
ulation and price competition in the electric industry,
particularly for industrial loads.

In 1994 we will complete the divestiture of
SCANA Development Corporation, which will con-
clude our direct participation in the real estate
development business. During my tenure, a key
goal for SCANA Corporation has been to focus on
energy and energy-related businesses. I am
pleased that after this transaction, we will have
substantially achieved that goal.
Many positive things have occurred in the past
twelve months which are outlined in some detail in
this report. While the energy industry in general,
and the electric industry in particular, continue to
change and become more competitive, SCANA
Corporation is moving forward with great success,
adapting to the new realities while continuing to
meet the needs of our customers, shareholders,
and employees.
As a group, active and retired employees own
11.4% of the common stock of our Company. Their
level of financial investment is unique. Much more
importantly, however, it is the cumulative commit-
ment to success, the expertise and hard work of our
employees which moves us forward every day.
I am very proud of the progress outlined in this
report and with the momentum which we have
achieved. It will not be easy to surpass the best
year in our Company's history, but we have out-
standing human resources, a strong financial con-
dition and a history of operational excellence to
drive us forward.

February 7, 1994AN OVERVIEW OF SCANA
SCANA Corporation is a family
of companies with Investments
concentrated in energy-related
businesses. We generate and
deliver electricity. We maintain
and operate power plants for
third parties. We own, develop
and produce natural gas
reserves. We market and trans-
port natural gas. We sell
propane. We are leaders in the
føld of fiber optic telecommuni-
cations. And we encourage
community and economic
davalopment through matching
grant and loan programs. SCANA
provides the energy and services
that help South Carolina and the
nation grow. Our strategy of
diversifying into energy-related
fields has a proven track record
in 27 states throughout the
country, as 1953 proved to be a
successful and profitable year.
We will continue to focus our
efforts on energy-rolatad
businesses. We are proud of our
accomplishments and excitad
about the future.
Electric OperationS
SCANA's largest subsidiary
continues on a fast track
preparing for competition in the
electric utility industry. We are
transforming our company from
a successful, regulated utility
into an excellent free-market
competitor. During 1993 we
laid important structural
groundwork for the changes we
must make. We fully imple-
mented a strategic business
unit concept and continued to
refine our control processes to
better track and minimize costs.
A strengthened commitment
to research and technology
transfer opportunities provides
us with expanded business
opportunities and new services.
In collaboration with the Electric
Power Research Institute, we
are developing programs to
recycle more waste products,
refine high speed circuit breaker
technology and generate inter-
est in solar-powered photo-
voltaic panels.
Another important part of
our transformation is targeting
customer service
and new technolo-
gies. We are com-
mitted to a customer
focused, continuous
improvement con-
cept that stresses
customer service and

make it easier for our customers
to do business with us.
During 1993 construction of
a new $450 million baseload
generating station near Cope, SC
continued ahead of schedule and
on budget. The 385-megawatt
coal-fired facility is the sixth
fossil plant on SCE&G's system.
It also will be one of the most
environmentally-sensitive plants
ever constructed when it begins
operations in 1996.
SCE&G was granted a two-
phase increase in retail electric
base rates in 1993 totaling
$60.5 million or 7.4 percent on
an annual basis. The additional
revenue will allow us to recover
carrying costs associated withthe ongoing construction of the
new plant. This represented our
first electric rate increase in
nearly four years. However, dur-
ing the remainder of the decade,
we will incur capital expendi-
tures that could require addi-
tional rate actions. These
expenditures involve completion
of the plant Cope and compli-
ance with requirements of the
Clean Air Act. We will maintain
our competitive position by con-
trolling costs, selling aggres-
sively, and pursuing economic
development opportunities.
Nuclear Operations
One of the most significant
short-term challenges we face
involves replacing the steam
generators at the V.C. Summer
Nuclear Station. These three
large heat exchangers have
experienced tube cracks and
eaks since the beginning of
plant operations in 1984 and
must be replaced to ensure con-
tinued reliability. The work will
be done in conjunction with a
refueling outage scheduled for
the fall of 1994 and represents
the largest modification antici-
pated during the life of the plant.
In a related matter, we reached
a settlement with Westinghouse
Electric Corporation in January
1994 that resolved a dispute
over the steam generators.
SCE&G filed suit in May 1990
against Westinghouse in the
U.S. District Court for South
Carolina seeking compensation
for damages to Summer Station.
Terms of the settlement are con-
fidential and have been sealed
by the court. However, it is our
opinion that the settlement was
in the best interest of all parties
and avoided what could have
been a costly and uncertain trial.
During 1993 Summer
Station continued its tradition of
operational excellence. For the
fourth consecutive time the
plant was recognized as having
one of the highest safety perfor-
mance records in the nation.
The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission granted this latest
"excellent" rating to only five of
the 109 nuclear power plants
operating in the United States.
In addition, the Commission's
latest Systematic Assessment of
Licensee Performance (SALP)
report rated Summer Station's
overall performance as "excel-
lent" for the 18-month period
from September 1991 through
February 1993.
We continue moving
aggressively to increase off-
peak and nonweather-related
sales of natural gas. We envi-
sion going beyond the meter to
offer services for appliances
and other equipment. Substantial
opportunities exist to capture
new markets in space and
water heating and air condition-
ing. Particularly promising is a
new market for natural gas
vehicles. The Comprehensive
National Energy Policy Act of
1992 included mandates for
government fleets and others to
convert to alternative fuels. We

succeeded in making progress
during 1993 for natural gas to be
the fuel of choice for this conver-
sion. We reached an agreement
with the federal government to be
the fuel supplier for 275 natural
gas vehicles ordered for its
Savannah River Site facility..
Restructuring of the natural
gas industry continues. The
Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission's Order 636 will
result in cost shifting among
some customer classes and a
greater responsibility to be a reli-
able supplier of natural gas to our
utility markets. We will systemati-
cally evaluate our gas purchasing
and delivery practices as the
evolution of the natural gas
industry continues.Aung 1993 we completed

South Cartina Pipeline
Corporation
Order 636 will have a sub-
stantial impact on SCANA'S gas
transmission subsidiary as well
by changing the method by
which we contract to receive
natural gas. While Pipeline
Corporation still has an obliga-
tion to be a supplier (as it is still
regulated by The Public Service
Commission of South Carolina),
over time we will become pri-
marily a transportation vehicle
for natural gas. The ownership
and sale of the gas will be han-
dled by unregulated suppliers
dealing directly with end-users.
Our current mission is to match
natural gas supplies with prices
our customers will pay. We have
structured the company to oper-
ate successfully in this increas-
ingly competitive environment,
and have implemented a natur-
al gas supply plan that includes
flexible sales agreements.
This strategy aligns our
wellhead commitments with
stored gas and spot purchases
to create the proper volume of
natural gas available at the
proper times for our customers,
while minimizing its cost. We
also are considering expansion
into North Carolina markets as
part of a growth plan.
SCANA Petroleum Resources, Inc.
SCANA's largest non-regulat-
ed subsidiary is capitalizing on
attractive new business oppor-
tunities by acquiring high value
oil and natural gas reserves as
restructuring occurs in the
domestic exploration and pro-
duction industry. We nearly
doubled our reserves in 1993
with the purchase of NICOR
Exploration and Production
Company of Denver. Petroleum
Resources now ranks among
the largest independent oil and
natural gas producers in the
country. Houston-based
Petroleum Resources now owns
approximately 238 billion cubic
feet equivalent of proven natural
gas reserves, representing o
total investment of about $248
million. None of these reserves
is delivered to South Carolina,
thereby forcing geographic
diversity and growth. We will
continue to seek attractive
acquisitions that complement
our existing dornestic reserve
base.
SCANA Hydrocarbons, Inc.
Order 636 allows direct
sales of natural gas to end-
users. SCANA Hydrocarbons
operates in this capacity. Our
advantage over competitors is
our knowledge of end-users'
needs and our reputation as a
high-quality marketing compa-
ny. We continue to build that
advantage by maintaining our
reputation with existing cus-
tomers and working to develop
relationships with new customers
that are mutually beneficial.
With offices in Columbla and
Houston, SCANA Hydrocarbons
is handling expanded marketing
responsibilities for Petroleum
Resources. We sold approxi-
mately 57.3 billion cubic feet of
natural gas in 1993 from
Petroleum Resources and other
third-party suppliers to cus-
tomers in 27 states. These sales
represent a 119 percent increase
over 1992.Suburban P pane Group, Inc
ī
Aggressive marketing is the
thrust of Suburban Propane
Group, fully integrated now
from the merger of three sepa-
rate companies in prior years.
This subsidiary serves 30,000
customers primarily in South
Carolina. Our focus is on pro-
viding the highest level of ser-
vice at a competitive price. We
continue to add customers in
the areas we already serve,
while pursuing growth through
additional acquisitions of other
retail propane operations.
During 1993 we added two
new offices in Columbia and
Darlington, SC to sell propane
and gas appliances. We now
sell, install and repair all types
of natural and propane gas
appliances from 19 separate
stores. Propane sales In 1993
totaled approximately 20 mil-
lion gallons.
Primosouth, hc.
We curtailed Primesouth's

SCANA's telecommunications
subsidiary operates a fiber optic-
based network consisting of
more than 600 miles of fiber
optics in South Carolina,
Georgia and Alabama. We lease
these facilities to major carriers
in those states. We expanded in
1993 by building additional
capacity in Georgia and Alabama
and continue to look for new
communications-related ventures
in other southeastern states.
We also developed and are
marketing an emergency radio
network that will make common
communication available to all
public safety and law enforce-
ment agencies within the state of
South Carolina. This public safety
network can provide independent
communications for individual
agencies. But more importantly,
it ties together all emergency
service providers in the event of
a natural disaster or other emer-
gency situations. Approximately
40 percent of the state is cur-
rently covered by this system.
We will continue to aggressively
market this critical public safety
network throughout the rest of
7
the state. By utilizing the public
safety network as our wireless
platform and capitalizing on our
fiber infrastructure, we will be
uniquely positioned to vigorous-
ly pursue new markets as appli-
cations unfold that are driven by
the "information super highway."
SCANA Development Corporation
Consistent with our strategic
plan to concentrate our efforts on
core energy businesses, we
have entered into an agreement
to sell in 1994 substantially all
of the assets of SCANA
Development Corporation, our
real estate subsidiary. Upon
completion of the sale, SDC
operations will be discontinued.
The sale will not have a material
impact on results of operations.SCANA Corporation

32Management Report
The management of SCANA Corporation
(Company) is responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the financial data included in the accompa-
nying Consolidated Financial Statements. These state-
ments have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, as applicable. In situ-
ations that prevent exact accounting measurements,
management has used informed judgments and esti-
mates. Financial information presented elsewhere in
this Annual Report is consistent with these financial
statements.
The Company maintains and relies upon a system
of internal accounting controls designed to provide rea-
sonable assurance that all transactions are properly
recorded in the books and records and that assets are
protected against loss or unauthorized use. The degree
of internal accounting control is based upon the deter-
mination of the optimum balance between the cost
incurred in maintaining a system of internal controls
and the benefits to be derived. The system of internal
accounting controls is supported by written policies and
guidelines and is complemented by the selection,
training and development of professional financial
managers and by a staff of internal auditors who con-
duct comprehensive internal audits.
The Board of Directors provides oversight for the
preparation of the financial statements through its Audit
Committee, which is composed entirely of nonemploy-
ee directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically
with management and internal auditors to review their
activities and responsibilities. The Audit Committee
also meets periodically with the Company's indepen-
dent auditors, Deloitte & Touche. The internal and inde-
pendent auditors have free access to the Audit
Committee to discuss internal accounting controls,
auditing and financial reporting matters.

SCANA CORPORATION:
We have audited the Consolidated Balance Sheets
and Consolidated Statements of Capitalization of
SCANA Corporation and subsidiaries (Company) as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related
Consolidated Statements of Income and Retained
Earnings and of Cash Flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1993. These finan-
cial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opin-
ion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with gen-
erally accepted auditing standards. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence support-
ing the amounts and disclosures in the financial state-
ments. An audit also includes assessing the account-
ing principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall finan-
cial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Company at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1993 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT: IG POLICI
A. Organization and Principles of Consolidation
SCANA Corporation (Company), a South Carolina corporation,
is a public utility holding company within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, but is exempt from registration
under such Act.
(+
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect
the consolidation of the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries:
Regulated utilities
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G)
South Carolina Fuel Company, Inc.
South Carolina Generating Company, Inc. (GENCO)
South Carolina Pipeline Corporation (Pipeline Corporation)
Nonregulated businesses
SCANA Petroleum Resources, Inc. (Petroleum Resources)
SCANA Hydrocarbons, Inc.
Suburban Propane Group, Inc.
SCANA Development Corporation
MPX Systems, Inc.
Primesouth, Inc.
SCANA Capital Resources, Inc.
Investments in joint ventures In real estate are reported using
the equity method of accounting. Significant Intercompany balances
and transactions have been ellminated In consolidation.
In January 1994 the Company signed an agreement to sell in
1994 substantially all of the real estate assets of SCANA
Development Corporation to Liberty Properties Group, Inc. of
Greenville, South Carolina for $91.5 million. Under the terms of the
agreement, a portion of the sales price will be received In cash at
the time of closing. The remainder of the sales price, which is relat-
ed to certain projects currently under construction, will be received In
cash as those projects are completed. The transaction will not have
a material impact on results of operations.
B. System of Accounts
The accounting records of the Company's regulated subsidi-
aries are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of
Accounts prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) and as adopted by The Public Service Commission of South
Carolina (PSC).
C. Utility Plant
Utillty plant is stated substantially at original cost. The costs of
additions, renewals and betterments to utility plant, including direct
labor, material and indirect charges for engineering, supervision and
an allowance for funds used during construction, are added to utility
plant accounts. The original cost of utility property retired or other-
wise disposed of is removed from utility plant accounts and
generally charged, along with the cost of removal, less salvage, to
accumulated depreciation. The costs of repairs, replacements and
renewals of Iterns of property determined to be less than a unit of
property are charged to maintenance expense.
SCE&G, operator of the V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (Summer
Station), and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (PSA) are
joint owners of Summer Station in the proportions of two-thirds and
one-third, respectively. The partles share the operating costs and
energy output of the plant in these proportions. Each party, how-
ever, provides its own financing. Plant In service related to SCE&G's
portion of Summer Station was approximately $920.2 million and
$916.0 million as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
Accumulated depreciation associated with SCE&G's share of
Summer Station was approximately $285.3 million and
$262.2 million as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.
SCE&G's share of the direct expenses associated with operating
Summer Station is included in the Company's 'Other operation" and
"Maintenance expenses.
D. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for funds used during construction (AFC), a noncash
Item, reflects the perlod cost of capital devoted to plant under con-
struction. This accounting practice results in the Inclusion, as a
component of construction cost, of the costs of debt and equity capi-
tal dedicated to construction investment. AFC Is included In rate
base investment and depreciated as a component of plant cost In
establishing rates for utility services. The Company's regulated sub-
sidiaries calculated AFC using composite rates of 9.3%, 9.6% and
9.7% for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. These rates do not
exceed the maximum allowable rate as calculated under FERC Order
No. 561. Interest on nuclear fuel in process is capitalized at the
actual interest amount.
E. Deferred Return on Plant investment
Commencing July 1, 1987, as approved by a PSC order on
that date, SCE&G ceased the deferral of carrying costs associated
with 400 MW of electric generating capacity previously removed
from rate base and began amortizing the accumulated deferred car-
rying costs on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period.
Amortization of deferred carrying costs, included in "Depreciation
and amortization," was approximately $4.2 million for each of
1993, 1992 and 1991.
F. Revenue Recognition
Customers' meters are read and bills are rendered on a
monthly cycle basis. Base revenue is recorded during the account-
ing period in which the meters are read."
Fuel costs for electric generation are collected through the fuel
component in retail electric rates. The fuel component contained in
electric rates is established by the PSC during semiannual fuel cost
hearings. Any difference between actual fuel cost and that contained
in the fuel component is deferred and Included when determining the
fuel cost component during the next semiannual fuel cost hearing.
At December 31, 1993 and 1992 SCE&G had overcollected
through the electric fuel clause component approximately
$9.2 million and $17.7 million, respectively, which are included
In 'Deferred Credits-Other."
Customers subject to the gas cost adjustment clause are billed
based on a fixed cost of gas determined by the PSC during annual
gas cost recovery hearings. Any difference between actual gas cost
and that contained in the rates is deferred and included when estab-
lishing gas costs during the next annual gas cost recovery hearing.
At December 31, 1993 and 1992 the Company had undercollected
through the gas cost recovery procedure approximately $12.0 mll-
lion and $6.2 million, respectively, which are Included in "Deferred
Debits-Other.*
G. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
Provisions for depreciation are recorded using the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes and are based on the esti-
mated service lives of the various classes of property. The compos-
ite weighted average depreciation rates were as follows:
SCE&G
GENCO
Pipeline Corporation

2.94%Nuclear fuel amortization, which is included in "Fuel used in
electric generation and is recovered through the fuel cost compo-
nent of SCE&G's rates, is recorded using the units-of-production
method. Provisions for amortization of nuclear fuel include amounts
necessary to satisfy obligations to the United States Department of
Energy under a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
The acquisition adjustment relating to the purchase of certain
gas properties in 1982 is being amortized over a 40-year period
using the straight-line method.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of the capitalized
costs of oil and gas producing propertles is provided for on the
units-of-production basls. Units-of-production rates are based on
estimated proven reserves.
H. Nuclear Decommissioning
Decommissioning of Summer Station is presently projected to
commence in the year 2022 when the operating license expires.
The expenditures (on a before-tax basis) related to SCE&G's share
of decommissioning activities are currently estimated, in 2022 dol-
lars assuming a 4.5% annual rate of inflation, to be approximately
$545.3 million including partial reclamation costs. SCE&G is pro-
viding for its share of estimated decommissioning costs of Summer
Station over the life of Summer Station. SCE&G collected through
rates $2.5 million and $1.6 million in 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The amounts collected are deposited in an external
trust fund in compliance with the financial assurance requirements
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Management intends for the
fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decom-
missloning expenditures on an after-tax basis.
In addition, pursuant to the National Energy Policy Act passed
by Congress in 1992, SCE&G has recorded a liability for its estimat-
ed share of amounts required by the U.S. Department of Energy for
its decommissioning fund. SCE&G will recover the costs associated
with this liability, totaling $4.6 million at December 31, 1993,
through the fuel cost component of Its rates; accordingly, these
amounts have been deferred and are included in "Deferred Debits-
Other" and "Long-term Debt, Net.*
1. Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated Federal and
State income tax returns. Income taxes are allocated to all subsid-
iaries based on their contributions to consolidated taxable income.
The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," effective
January 1, 1993. Prior years' financial statements have not been
restated. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were adjusted from the
amounts recorded at December 31, 1992 under prior standards to
the amounts required at January 1, 1993 under Statement No. 109
at currently enacted income tax rates. The adjustments were
charged or credited to regulatory assets or llabilities if the Company
expects to recover the resulting additional Income tax expense from,
or pass through the resulting reductions in income tax expense to,
customers of the Company's regulated subsidiaries; otherwise they
were charged or credited to income tax expense. The cumulative
effect of adopting Statement No. 109 on retained earnings as of
January 1, 1993, as well as the effect of adoption on net Income for
the year ended December 31, 1993, was not material. The com-
bined effect of adopting Statement No. 109 and adjusting deferred
tax assets and liabilities for the change in 1993 of the corporate
Federal income tax rate from 34% to 35% resulted In balances of
$100.8 million in regulatory assets (included in "Deferred Debits-
Other") and $69.3 million in regulatory liabilitles (included in
*Deferred Credits-Other") for the Company's regulated subsidiaries.
'
In accordance with Statement No. 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded for the tax effect of temporary differences
between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities at currently
enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for
changes in such rates through charges or credits to regulatory assets
or liabilities if they are expected to be recovered from, or passed
through to, customers of the Company's regulated subsidiaries;
otherwise, they are charged or credited to income tax expense.
Prior to the adoption of Statement No. 109 on January 1, 1993,
the Company recorded a deferred income tax provision on all mater-
ial timing differences between the Inclusion of items in pretax finan-
cial income and taxable income each year, except for those which
were expected to be passed through to, or collected from, customers
of the Company's regulated subsidiarles. Accumulated deferred
income taxes were generally not adjusted for changes in enacted tax
rates.
J. Pension Expense
The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all permanent employees. Benefits are
based on years of accredited service and the employee's average
annual base earnings received during the last three years of employ-
ment. The Company's policy has been to fund pension costs
accrued to the extent permitted by the applicable Federal income tax
regulations as determined by an independent actuary.
Net periodic pension cost, as determined by an Independent
actuary, for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991

The change in the annual discount rate used to determine

Increased the projected benefit obligation and reduced the unrecog-
nized net gain by approximately $4.1 million.
In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits to active and retired
employees. On January 1, 1993 the Company adopted Statement
No. 106 "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other
Than Pensions. The Statement requires that the cost of postretire-
ment benefits other than pensions be accrued during the years the
employees render the service necessary to be eligible for the applic-
oble benefits. The Company previously expensed these benefits,
which are primarily health care, as claims were incurred. The accu-
mulated obligation for these benefits at January 1, 1993 was
approximately $68 million (transition liability) and the annualized
increase in expenses (net of payments to current retirees), including
the amortization of the transition liability over approximately 20
years as provided for by the Statement, is approximately $4.7 mil-
lion. In Its June 1993 electric rate order (see Note 2A) the PSC
approved the Inclusion in rates of the portion of increased expenses
related to electric operations. Such expenses had been deferred
through May 31, 1993 pursuant to a December 10, 1992
accounting directive allowing deferral pending consideration of
recovery in future rate proceedings. The Company expensed
approximately $4.3 million, net of payments to current retirees, for
the year ended December 31, 1993.

postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 1993
and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1993 would be to increase such amounts by
$60,000 and $1.7 million, respectively.
K. Debt Premium, Discount and Expense, Unamortized Loss on
Reacquired Debt
Long-term debt premium, discount and expense are being
amortized as components of interest on long-term debt, net over
the terms of the respective debt Issues. Gains or losses on reac-
quired debt that is refinanced are deferred and amortized over the
term of the replacement debt.
L. Environmental
The Company has an environmental assessment program to
identify and assess current and former operations sites that could
require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated,
an estimate is made of the amount of expenditures, If any, neces-
sary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are
refined as additional information becomes available; therefore actual
expenditures could significantly differ from the original estimates.
Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and
cleanup relate primarily to regulated operations; such amounts have
been deferred and are being amortized and recovered through rates
over a ten-year period. Such amounts totaled $19.6 million and
$18.3 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and
are included in "Deferred Debits-Other.*
M. Gas Futures Contracts
The Company sells gas futures contracts to hedge price risks
for a portion of Petroleum Resources' production. Gains and losses
on such contracts, which are not material, are recognized concur-
rently with the revenue from the associated gas sales.N. Postemployment Benefits
In November 1992 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemploy-
ment Benefits." The Statement, which is effective for calendar year
1994, establishes certain conditions for the recognition of costs of
benefits to former employees after employment but before retirement.
The Statement requires recognition of the obligation to provide post-
employment benefits If such obligation is attributable to services pre-
viously rendered, the obligation relates to rights which vest, payment
of the benefits is probable, and the amount of such benefits can be
reasonably estimated. The Company does not anticipate that appll-
cation of this Statement will have a significant impact on results of
operations or financial position.
0. Temporary Cash Investments
The Company considers temporary cash investments having
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Temporary cash Investments are generally in the form of commercial
paper, certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements.
P. Reclassifications
Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to
conform with the 1993 presentation.
2. RATE MATTERS:
A. On June 7, 1993 the PSC issued an order on the
Company's pending electric rate proceeding allowing an authorized
return on common equity of 11.5%, resulting in a 7.4% annual
Increase in retail electric rates, or a projected $60.5 million annually
based on a test year. These rates are to be implemented in two
phases over a two-year period: phase one, effective June 1993,
producing $42.0 million annually, and phase two, effective June
1994, producing $18.5 million annually, based on a test year.
B. On September 14, 1992 the PSC issued an order granting
SCE&G a $.25 Increase in transit fares from $.50 to $.75 in both
Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina; however, the PSC also
required $.40 fares for low income customers and denied SCE&G's
request to reduce the number of routes and frequency of service.
The new rates were placed into effect on October 5, 1992. SCE&G
has appealed the PSC's order to the Circult Court. During oral argu-
ments in February 1994 the Circuit Court retained jurisdiction and
remanded the decision to the PSC for the limited purpose of answer-
ing questions concerning the applicable regulatory principles used
by the PSC in determining these transit rates.
C. Since November 1, 1991 SCE&G's gas rate schedules for
its residential, small commercial and small Industrial customers
have included a weather normalization adjustment (WNA). The
WNA minimizes fluctuations in gas revenues due to abnormal
weather conditions and has been approved through November
1994 subject to an annual review by the PSC. The PSC order was
based on a return on common equity of 12.25% (see Note 2G).
The WNA become effective the first billing cycle in December 1991.
D. In May 1989 the PSC approved a volumetric and direct
billing method for Pipeline Corporation to recover take-or-pay costs
incurred from its interstate pipeline suppliers pursuant to FERC-
approved final and nonappealable settlements. In December 1992
the South Carolina Supreme Court (Supreme Court) approved Pipeline
Corporation's full recovery of the take-or-pay charges imposed by its
suppliers and treatment of these charges as a cost of gas. However,
the Supreme Court declared the PSC-approved "purchase deficiency
methodology for recovery of these costs to be unlawful retroactive
ratemaking and remanded the docket to the PSC to reconsider its
recovery methodology. The Company belleves that the elimination of
the purchase deficlency method of recovery will affect the timing for
recovery of take-or-pay charges and shift the allocations among
Pipeline Corporation's customers (including SCE&G) but that all such
charges should be ultimately recovered. The case has been remitted
to the PSC by the Supreme Court and the Company anticipates the
PSC will issue an Order authorizing full recovery of incurred take-or-
pay costs on a prospective volumetric basis after the completion of
accounting verification by the PSC Staff of the principal and associated
interest costs.
E. On August 8, 1990 the PSC issued an order, effective
November 1, 1990, approving changes In Pipeline Corporation's
gas rate design for sales for resale service and upholding the
"value-of-service" method of regulation for its direct industrial
service. Direct Industrial customers seeking "cost-of-service based
rates initiated two separate appeals to the Circuit Court, which
reversed and remanded to the PSC its August 8, 1990 order.
Pipeline Corporation appealed that decision to the Supreme Court
which reversed the two Circuit Court decisions and reinstated the
PSC Order. The Supreme Court held that the Industrial customer
group's appeal was premature and failed to exhaust administrative
remedies. Additionally, the Supreme Court interpreted the rate-
making statutes of South Carolina to give discretion to the PSC in
selecting the methodology to be used in setting rates for natural
gas service.
21
F. On July 3, 1989 the PSC granted SCE&G approximately
$21.9 million of a requested $27.2 million annual increase in retail
electric revenues based upon an allowed return on common equity of
13.25%. The Consumer Advocate appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court which, on August 31, 1992, found that the evidence in
the record of that case did not support a return on common equity
higher than 13.0% and remanded to the PSC a portion of Its July
1989 order for a determination of the proper return on common equity
consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion. On January 19, 1993
the PSC issued an order allowing a return on common equity of
13.0%, approving a refund based on the difference in rates created by
the difference between the 13.0% and the 13.25% retum on common
calculation
equity and making other non-material adjustments to the
of cost-of-service. The total refund, before interest and income taxes,
was approximately $14.6 million and was charged against 1992
"Electric Revenues. The refund plus interest was made during 1993.
G. On November 28, 1989 the PSC granted SCE&G an increase
In firm retall natural gas rates, effective November 30, 1989, de-
signed to Increase annual revenues by $10.1 million, or 89.5% out
of the requested increase of approximately $11.3 million. In its order
the PSC authorized a 12.75% return on common equity. The Con-
sumer Advocate appealed to the Supreme Court which on August 31,
1992 remanded the order to the PSC for redetermination of the proper
amount of litigation expenses to include in the test period. In January
1993 the PSC reduced the amount of litigation expense and ordered a
refund totaling approximately $163,000 which was charged against
1992 "Gas Revenues. The refund was made during 1993.
3. LONG-TERM DEBT:
The annual amounts of long-term debt maturities, including the
amounts due under the nuclear and fossil fuel agreement (see Note
4), and sinking fund requirements for the years 1994 through 1998
are summarized as follows:

debt for 1994 may be satisfied by either deposit and cancellation of
bonds issued upon the basis of property additions or band retire-
ment credits, or by deposit of cash with the Trustee.
During 1993 certain issues of SCE&G's First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds were redeemed and replaced with SCE&G's First
Mortgage Bonds.
In January 1994 the Company arranged for unsecured bank
loans totaling $60 million, due January 13, 1995 at interest rates
between 3.875% and 3.89%. Proceeds from the loan were used to
repay a $60 million bank loan due January 14, 1994; accordingly,
such loan is included in long-term debt at December 31, 1993.
Substantially all utility plant and fuel inventories are pledged as
collateral In connection with long-term debt.
4. FUEL FINANCINGS:
Nuclear and fossil fuel Inventories are financed through the
issuance of short-term commercial paper. These short-term borrow-
ings are supported by an irrevocable revolving credit agreement
which expires July 31, 1996. Accordingly, the amounts outstand-
Ing have been Included in long-term debt. The credit agreement
provides for a maximum amount of $75 million that may be out-
standing at any time.
Commercial paper outstanding totaled $36.8 million and
$55.7 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992 at weighted aver-
age interest rates of 3.47% and 3.81%, respectively.

The Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company do not
limit the dividends that may be payable on its common stock.
However, the Restated Articles of Incorporation of SCE&G and the
Indenture underlying its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds contain
provisions that may limit the payment of cash dividends on its com-
mon stock. In addition, with respect to hydroelectric projects, the
Federal Power Act may require the appropriation of a portion of the
eamings therefrom. At December 31, 1993 approximately $10.6
million of retained eamings were restricted as to payment of cash
dividends on common stock.
Cash dividends on common stock were declared at an annual
rate per share of $2.74, $2.68 and $2.62 for 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively.
6. PREFERRED STOCK (Subject to Purchase or Sinking Funds):
The call premium of the respective series of preferred stock in
no case exceeds the amount of the annual dividend. Retirements
under sinking fund requirements are at par values.
At any time when dividends have not been paid in full or
declared and set apart for payment on all series of preferred stock,
SCE&G may not redeem any shares of preferred stock (unless all
shares of preferred stock then outstanding are redeemed) or pur-
chase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of preferred stock
except in accordance with an offer made to all holders of preferred
stock. SCE&G may not redeem any shares of preferred stock
(unless all shares of preferred stock then outstanding are redeemed)
or purchase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of preferred
stock (except out of monles set aside as purchase funds or sinking
funds for one or more series of preferred stock) at any time when it
is in default under the provisions of the purchase fund or sinking
fund for any series of preferred stock.
The aggregate annual amounts of purchase fund or sinking
fund requirements for preferred stock for the years 1994 through

The information presented herein is based on pertinent information
available to the Company as of December 31, 1993 and 1992.
Although the Company is not aware of any factors that would signifi-
cantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such financial Instru-
ments have not been comprehensively revalued since December 31,
1993 and the current estimated fair value may differ significantly
from the estimated fair value at that date.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
the fair value of the above classes of financial instruments:
Cash and temporary cash investments, including commercial
paper, repurchase agreements, treasury bills and notes are valued
at their carrying amount.
Fair values of investments and long-term debt are based on
quoted market prices for similar instruments, or for those Instru-
ments for which there are no quoted market prices available, fair
values are based on net present value calculations. Investments
which are not considered to be financial instruments (goodwill)
have been excluded from the carrying amount and estimated fairvalue. Settlement of long-term debt may not be possible or may not
be a prudent management decision.
Short-term borrowings are valued at their carrying amount.
The fair value of preferred stock (subject to purchase or
sinking funds) and gas futures contracts is estimated on the basis
of market prices.
Potential taxes and other expenses that would incurred in an
actual sale or settlement have not been taken into consideration.
9. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:
The Company pays fees to banks as compensation for Its lines
of credit. Commercial paper borrowings are for 270 days or less.
Details of lines of credit and short-term borrowings at December 31,

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
A. Construction
SCE&G entered into a contract with Duke/Fluor Daniel in
1991 to design, engineer and build a 385 MW coal-fired electric
generating plant near Cape, South Carolina in Orangeburg County.
Construction of the plant began in November 1992 and commercial
operation is expected in late 1995 or early 1996. The estimated
price of the Cope plant, excluding financing costs and AFC but
including an allowance for escalation, is $450 million. In addition,
the transmission lines for interconnection with the Company's
system are expected to cost $26 million.
$168,152
59,766
5,603
$233,521
Under the Duke/Fluor Daniel contract SCE&G must make
specified monthly minimum payments. These minimum payments
do not include amounts for inflation on a portion of the contract
which is subject to escalation (approximately 34% of the total con-
tract amount). The aggregate amount of such required minimum
payments remaining at December 31, 1993 Is as follows (thousands
of dollars):
Through December 31, 1993 SCE&G paid $142.0 million
under the contract.
B. Nuclear Insurance
The Price-Anderson Indemnification Act, which deals with pub-
lic liability for a nuclear Incident, currently establishes the liability
limit for third-party claims associated with any nuclear incident at
$9.4 billion. Each reactor licensee is currently llable for up to
$79.3 million per reactor owned for each nuclear incident occurring
at any reactor in the United States, provided that not more than $10
million of the llability per reactor would be assessed per year.
SCE&G's maximum assessment, based on its two-thirds ownership
of Summer Station, would be approximately $52.9 million per inci-
dent, but not more than $6.7 million per year.
SCE&G currently maintains policies (for itself and on behalf of
the PSA) with Nuclear Electric insurance Limited (NEIL) and
American Nuclear Insurers (ANI) providing combined property and
decontamination insurance coverage of $1.4 billion for any losses
in excess of $500 million pursuant to existing primary coverages
(with ANI) on Summer Station. SCE&G pays annual premiums and,
in addition, could be assessed a retroactive premium not to exceed
7 1/2 times its annual premium In the event of property damage
loss to any nuclear generating facilities covered by NEIL. Based on
the current annual premium, this retroactive premium would not
exceed $8.1 million.
To the extent that insurable claims for property damage, decon-
tamination, repair and replacement and other costs and expenses
arising from a nuclear Incident at Summer Station exceed the policy
limits of insurance, or to the extent such insurance becomes un-
available in the future, and to the extent that SCE&G's rates would
not recover the cost of any purchased replacement power, SCE&G
will retain the risk of loss as a self-insurar. SCE&G has no reason to
anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Summer Station. If such an
incident were to occur, it could have a materially adverse impact on
the Company's financial position.
C. Litigation
In January 1994 SCE&G, acting on behalf of Itself and the PSA
(as co-owners of Summer Station), reached a settlement with
Westinghouse Electric Corporation (Westinghouse) resolving a dis-
pute involving steam generators provided by Westinghouse to
Summer Station which are defective in design, workmanship and
materials. Terms of the settlement are confidential by agreement of
the parties and order of the court. SCE&G had filled an action In May
1990 against Westinghouse in the U.S. District Court for South
Carolina; an order dismissing this suit was issued on January 12,
1994.
D. Environmental
As described in Note 1L, the Company has an environmental
assessment program to identify and assess current and former oper-
ations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site
assessments are initiated, an estimate Is made of the amount of
expenditures, if any, necessary to investigate and clean up each
site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes
available; therefore actual expenditures could significantly differ from
the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for
site assessments and cleanup relate primarily to regulated opera-
tions; such amounts have been deferred and are being amortized
and recovered through rates over a ten-year period.11. SEGMENT OF BUSINESS INFORMATIC:

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The cash requirements of the Company arise primarily from
SCE&G's operational needs, the Company's construction program
and the need to fund the activities or investments of the Company's
nonregulated subsidiarles. The ability of the Company's regulated
subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, as well as to
expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend
upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reason-
able terms. The Company's regulated subsidiaries recover the costs
of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for
regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As
customer growth and inflation occur and the regulated subsidiaries
expand their construction programs, it is necessary to seek in-
creases in rates. As a result the Company's future financial position
and results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidi-
arles' ability to obtain adequate and timely rate relief.
Due to continuing customer growth, SCE&G entered into a con-
tract with Duke/Fluor Daniel in 1991 to design, engineer and build a
385 MW coal-fired electric generating plant near Cope, South
Carolina in Orangeburg County. Construction of the plant began in
November 1992 with commercial operation expected in late 1995
or early 1996. The estimated price of the Cope plant, excluding
financing costs and allowance for funds used during construction
(AFC) but including an allowance for escalation, Is $450 million. In
addition, the transmission lines for Interconnection with the
Company's system are expected to cost $26 million. Until the com-
pletion of the new plant, SCE&G is contracting for additional capaci-
ty as necessary to ensure that the energy demands of its customers
can be met.
As discussed in Note 2A of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, on June 7, 1993 The Public Service Commission of
South Carolina (PSC) issued an order granting SCE&G a 7.4%
annual increase in retail electric rates to be implemented in two
phases of $42.0 million annually effective June 1993 and $18.5
million annually effective June 1994, based on a test year.
Approximately 28% of total cash requirements (excluding divi-
dends) was provided from internal sources in 1993 as compared to
40% in 1992.
1 Results of Operations
SCE&G has placed a new bond indenture (New Mortgage)
dated April 1, 1993 on substantially all of its electric properties
under which its future mortgage-backed debt (New Bonds) will be
issued. New Bonds are expected to be issued under the New
Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds
issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the
Trustee of the New Mortgage (of which $157 million were available
for such purpose as of December 31, 1993), until such time as all
presently outstanding Class A Bonds are retired. Thereafter, New
Bonds will be issuable on the basis of property additions in a princi-
pal amount equal to 70% of the original cost of electric and com-
mon plant properties (compared to 60% of value for Class A Bonds
under the Old Mortgage), cash deposited with the Trustee, and
retirement of New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the
New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for
12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding
the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest require-
ments on all outstanding bonds (Including Class A Bonds) and New
Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended
December 31, 1993 the New Bond Ratio was 5.0.
The Company has in effect a medium-term note program for
the Issuance from time to time of unsecured medlum-term debt
securities. The proceeds from the sales of these securities may be
used to fund additional business activities in nonutility subsidiaries,
to reduce short-term debt incurred in connection therewith or for gen-
eral corporate purposes. In 1993 the Company issued $60 million
of such medium-term notes. The proceeds from the sales of these
securities were used for the funding of nonutility subsidiary activities.
At December 31, 1993 the Company has available for issuance
$67.6 million under the current registration statement.
SCE&G's First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated
April 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage), contains provisions prohibiting the
Issuance of additional bonds thereunder (Class A Bonds) unless net
earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the
15 months prior to the month of issuance Is at least twice the
annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding
(Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 1993 the Bond
Ratio was 3.70. The issuance of additional Class A Bonds is
restricted also to an additional principal amount equal to 60% of
unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property add-
tions totaled approximately $219.9 million at December 31, 1993),
Class A Bonds Issued on the basis of retirements of Class A Bonds
(which retirement credits totaled $10.9 million at December 31,
1993), and Class A Bonds issued on the basis of cash on deposit
with the Trustee.
On April 29, 1993 the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) declared effective a registration statement for the issuance of
up to $700 million of First Mortgage Bonds by SCE&G under the
New Mortgage. The following series, aggregating $600 million,
have been issued under such registration statement:
• On June 9, 1993, $100 million, 7 5/8% Series due June 1,
2023 to repay short-term borrowings in a like amount.
•
On July 1, 1993, $100 million, 6% Series due June 15, 2000;
and $150 million, 7 1/8% Serles due June 15, 2013; and on July
20, 1993, $150 million, 7 1/2 % Series due June 15, 2023, to
redeem, on July 20, 1993, $382,035,000 of First and Refunding
Mortgage Bonds maturing between 1999 and 2017 and bearing
interest at rates between 8% and 9 7/8% per annum.
• On December 20, 1993, $100 million, 6 1/4% Serles due
December 15, 2003 to repay short-term borrowings in a like
amount.
20
The following additional financing transactions have occurred
since December 31, 1992:
. On January 15, 1993 the Company closed on an unsecured
bank loan in the principal amount of $60 million, due January 14,
1994, and used the proceeds to pay off a loan in a like amount.
The Interest rate is the three month LIBOR plus 30 basis points and
is reset quarterly. On January 14, 1994 the Company refinanced
the loan with unsecured bank loans totaling $60 million, due
January 13, 1995 at Interest rates between 3.875% and 3.89%.
• On April 15, 1993 the Company arranged for a $15 million term
loan, due April 14, 1994, to repay short-term borrowings In a like
amount. The interest rate is the three month LIBOR plus 16 basis
points and is reset quarterly.
• On June 1, 1993 SCE&G redeemed the following amounts of First
and Refunding Mortgage Bonds: $35 million, 10 1/8% Series due
2009 and $13 million, 9 7/8% Series due 2009.
• On June 2, 1993 the Company entered into a $123 million
90-day bank loan (90-day bank loan) to finance the acquisition by
Petroleum Resources of approximately 125 billion cubic feet equiva-
lent of natural gas reserves through the purchase of NICOR
Exploration and Production Company. (NICOR).
• On July 1, 1993 the Company Issued $60 million of medium-
term notes bearing interest at the following rates and maturing on
the following dates in the following amounts: $20 million, 5.76%,
due July 1, 1998; $20 million, 6.15%, due July 3, 2000; $20
million, 6.51%, due July 1, 2003. The proceeds were used to
repay a portion of the 90-day bank loan discussed above.In early August 1993 the Company issued 1,467,000 shares of
common stock with net proceeds totaling $69,345,090. The pro-
ceeds were used to repay the remainder of the 90-day bank loan
previously discussed and for general corporate purposes.
• On September 30, 1993 Pipeline Corporation sold unsecured
promissory notes totaling $25 million, 6.72% due September 30,
2013. The proceed were used to repay short-term borrowings In a
like amount.
Without the consent of at least a majority of the total voting
power of SCE&G's preferred stock, SCE&G may not issue or assume
any unsecured indebtedness If, after such Issue or assumption, the
total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would
exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&G's
secured Indebtedness and capital and surplus; provided, however,
that no such consent shall be required to enter into agreements for
payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for
pollution control purposes.
Pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act, SCE&G and
GENCO must obtain FERC authority to issue short-term indebted-
ness. The FERC has authorized SCE&G to issue up to $200 million
of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity
dates of 12 months or less but not later than December 31, 1995.
GENCO has not sought such authorization.
The Company has $175.0 million authorized lines of credit
and has unused Ines of credit of $148.0 million at December 31,
1993. In addition, the Company has a credit agreement for a maxl-
mum of $75 million to finance nuclear and fossil fuel inventories,
with $38.2 million available at December 31, 1993.
SCE&G's Restated Articles of Incorporation prohibit issuance of
additional shores of preferred stock without consent of the preferred
stockholders unless net earnings (as defined therein) for the 12
consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance is
at least one and one-half times the aggregate of all Interest charges
and preferred stock dividend requirements (Preferred Stock Ratio).
For the year ended December 31, 1993 the Preferred Stock Ratio
was 2.52.
On October 12, 1993 the Company registered with the SEC
2,000,000 additional shares of the Company's common stock to be
issued and sold under the Dividend Relnvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan (DRP).
$350
During 1993 the Company issued 529,954 shares of the
Company's common stock
under the DRP. In addition,
the Company issued
705,498 shares of Its com-
mon stock pursuant to its
Stack Purchase-Savings Plan
(SPSP). The Company has
authorized and reserved for
issuance, and registered
under effective registration
statements, 2,065,824 and
872,420 shares of common
stock pursuant to the DRP

of the agreement, a portion of the sales price will be received in
cash at the time of closing. The remainder of the sales price, which
is related to certain projects currently under construction, will be
received in cash as those projects are completed. The net proceeds
from the sale will be used to retire Development Corporation's debt
and for general corporate purposes, including the funding of other
nonutility subsidiaries' business activities. The transaction will not
have a material impact on results of operations.
Estimated capital requirements for construction in the year
1994 are reflected in the Cash Requirements chart.
27
The Company anticipates that its 1994 cash requirements of
$559.7 will be met through internally generated funds (approxi-
mately 38% excluding dividends), the sales of additional equity
securities and the incurrence of additional short-term and long-term
indebtedness. The timing and amount of such financing will depend
upon market conditions and other factors. Actual 1994 expendl-
tures may vary from the estimates set forth above due to factors
such as inflation and economic conditions, regulation and legisla-
tion, rates of load growth, environmental protection standards and
the cost and availability of capital.
The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate
sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements.
Environmental Matters
The Clean Air Act requires electric utilities to reduce substan-
tally emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide by the year
2000. These requirements are being phased in over two periods.
The first phase has a compliance date of January 1, 1995 and the
second, January 1, 2000. The Company meets all requirements of
Phase I and therefore will not have to implement changes until com-
pliance with Phase II requirements is necessary. The Company then
will most likely meet Its compliance requirements through the burn-
ing of natural gas and/or lower sulfur coal, the addition of scrubbers
to coal-fired generating units, and the purchase of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances. Low nitrogen oxide burners will be installed
to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.
The Company is continuing to refine a compliance plan that
must be filed with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
by January 1, 1996. The Company currently estimates that air
emissions control equipment will require capital expenditures of
$252 million over the 1994-1998 period to retrofit existing facilities
and an increased operation and maintenance cost of $31 million
per year. To meet compliance requirements through the year 2003,
the Company anticipates total capital expenditures of $275 million.
The South Carolina Solid Waste Policy and Management Act of
1991 requires promulgation of regulations addressing specified
subjects, one of which affects the management of industrial solid
waste. This regulation will establish minimum criteria for Industrial
landillls as mandated under the Act. The proposed regulation, if
adopted as a final regulation in its present form, could significantly
impact SCE&G's and GENCO's engineering, design and operation of
existing and future ash management facilities. Potential cost
impacts could be substantial.
As described In Note 1L of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company has an environmental assessment pro-
gram to identify and assess current and former operations sites that
could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initi-
ated, an estimate is made of the amount of expenditures, If any,
necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates
are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore
actual expenditures could significantly differ from the original estl-
mates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date ($19.6 million) forsite assessments and cleanup of regulated operations have been
deferred and are being amortized and recovered through rates over a
ten-year perlod. Estimates to date include, among other things, the
costs estimated to be associated with the matters discussed in the
following paragraphs.
The Company and its principal subsidiary, SCE&G, each own.
two decommissioned manufactured gas plant sites which contain
residues of by-product chemicals. The Company and SCE&G hove
each maintained an active review of their respective sites to monitor
the nature and extent of the residual contamination.
In September 1992 the EPA notified SCE&G, the City of
Charleston and the Charleston Housing Authority of their potential
liability for the investigation and cleanup of the Calhoun Park Area
Site in Charleston, South Carolina. This site originally encompassed
approximately 18 acres and included properties which were the
locations for industrial operations, including a wood preserving (cre-
osote) plant and one of SCE&G's decommissioned manufactured
gas plants. The original scope of this investigation has been
expanded to approximately 30 acres including adjacent properties
owned by the National Park Service and City of Charleston, and pri-
vate properties. The site has not been placed on the National
Priority List, but may be added before cleanup is initiated. The
potentially responsible parties (PRP) have agreed with the EPA to
participate in an innovative approach to site investigation and
cleanup called "Superfund Accelerated Cleanup Model," allowing the
pre-cleanup site investigations process to be compressed signifi-
cantly. The PRPS have negotiated an administrative order by con-
sent for the conduct of a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study
(RI/FS) and a corresponding Scope of Work. Actual field work
began November 1, 1993 after final approval and authorization was
granted by EPA. SCE&G is also working with the City of Charleston
to investigate potential contamination from the manufactured gas
plant at the city's aquarium site.
During 1993 SCE&G settled Its obligations at the Yellow Water
Road Superfund Site near Jacksonville, Florida, the Spencer
Transformer and Equipment Site in West Virginia and Elliott's Auto
Parts in Benton, Arkansas. No further expenses are anticipated for
these sites.
SCE&G has been listed as a PRP and has recorded llabilities,
which are not considered material, for the Macon-Dockery waste
disposal site near Rockingham, North Carolina, the Aqua-Tech
Environmental, Inc. site in Greer, South Carolina and a landfill
owned by Lexington County in South Carolina.
Litigation
In January 1994 SCE&G, acting on behalf of itself and the PSA
(as co-owners of Summer Station), reached a settlement with
Westinghouse resolving a dispute involving steam generators pro-
vided by Westinghouse to Summer Station which are defective in
design, workmanship and materials. Terms of the settlement are
confidential by agreement of the parties and order of the court.
SCE&G had filed an action in May 1990 against Westinghouse in
the U.S. District Court for South Carolina; an order dismissing this
sult was issued on January 12, 1994.
Regulatory Matters
On June 7, 1993 the PSC issued an order on SCE&G's pend-
ing electric rate proceeding allowing an authorized return on com-
mon equity of 11.5%, resulting in a 7.4% annual increase in retaill
electric rates, or a projected $60.5 million annually on a test year
basis. These rates are to be implemented in two phases over a
two-year period: phase one, effective June 1993, producing $42.0
million annually, and phase two, effective June 1994, producing
$18.5 million annually, on a test year basis.
The Company's regulated business operations are likely to be
impacted by the National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) and FERC Order
No. 636. NEPA is designed to create a more competitive wholesale
power supply market by creating exempt wholesale generators and
by potentially requiring utilities owning transmission facilities to pro-
vide transmission access to wholesalers. Order No. 636 is Intended
to deregulate the markets for interstate sales of natural gas by
requiring that pipelines provide transportation services that are equal
in quality for all gas suppliers whether the customer purchases gas
from the pipeline or another supplier. In the opinion of the
Company, it will be able to meet successfully the challenges of
these altered business climates.

In November 1992 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." The Statement, which is effective for cal-
endar year 1994, establishes certain conditions for the recognition
of costs of benefits to former employees after employment but before
retirement. The Statement requires recognition of the obligation to
provide postemployment benefits if such obligation is attributable to
services previously rendered, the obligation relates to rights which
vest, payment of the benefits is probable and the amount of such
benefits can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not
anticipate that application of this Statement will have a significant
Impact on results of operations or financial position.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Earnings and Dividends
Earnings per share of common stock, the percent increase
(decrease) from the previous year and the rate of return earned on
common equity for the years 1991 through 1993 were as follows:
Earnings per share
Percent increase (decrease)

equity (year-end)
1993
$3.72
31.0%
1992

(15.7%)
10.1%
1991
$3.37
(24.1%)
12.6%
13.2%
. 1993 Earnings per share and retum on common equity increased
In 1993 primarily due to a higher electric sales margin and addi-
flonal nonoperating income.
• 1992 Earnings per share and return on common equity in 1992
decreased primarily due to the recording of an $11.1 million (after
interest and Income taxes) reserve against eamings related to the
August 31, 1992 retall electric rate ruling from the South Carolina
Supreme Court (see Note 2F of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements) and increases in other operating and Interest expenses.
The Company's financial statements Include AFC. AFC is a
utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both
equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which Is
shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is
capitalized. Both an equity and debt portion of AFC are included in
nonoperating Income as noncash items which have the effect of
increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately
5.8% of income before Income taxes In 1993, 5.5% in 1992 and
3.9% in 1991.
In 1993 the Company's Board of Directors raised the quarterly
cash dividend on common stock to 68.5 cents per share from 67
cents per share. The increase, effective with the dividend payable
on April 1, 1993, raised the Indicated annual dividend rate to $2.74
per share from $2.68. The Company has increased the dividend
rate on its common stock in 40 of the last 41 years.Electric Operations
• 1993 The increase in electric sales margin from 1992 to 1993 is
primarily a result of increased residential and commercial KWH
sales due to weather and customer growth, an increase in retail
electric rates beginning In June 1993 and the recording In 1992 of
a $14.6 million reserve as discussed below.
1992 The 1992 electric sales margin decreased from 1991 due
to the recording of a $14.6 million reserve, before Interest and
income taxes, related to the August 31, 1992 ruling from the South
Carolina Supreme Court (see Note 2F of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements) and a $1.9 million billing-related litigation
settlement included in 1991 electric operating revenues.
Warmer weather and an Increase in the number of electric cus-
tomers resulted in an all-time peak demand record of 3,557 MW on
July 29, 1993. The previous year's record of 3,380 MW was set
on July 13, 1992.
Gas Operations
• 1993 In 1993 the gas sales margin decreased from 1992 as a
result of higher gas prices which reduced Pipeline Corporation's
sales due to the competitiveness of alternative fuels. This reduction
was partially offset by Increases in higher margin residential and
commercial sales and increased transportation volumes.
. 1992 The gas sales margin for 1992 increased from 1991 as a
result of recoveries of $4.2 million allowed under a weather normal-
Ization adjustment which become effective the first billing cycle in
December 1991; Increases in residential usage due to cooler weath-
er during 1992; and Increased transportation volumes.
Other Operating Expenses
• 1993 Other operation and maintenance expenses Increased for
1993 primarily due to the implementation of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 106 (see Note 1J of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements) pursuant to the June 1993 PSC
electric rate order and the amortization of environmental expenses.
The depreciation and amortization increase reflects additions to
plant in service. The increase in income taxes corresponds to the

increase in income and reflects the increase in the corporate tax rate
from 34% to 35% retroactive to January 1, 1993.
. 1992 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased for
1992 primarily due to increases in administrative and general
expenses, increases in nuclear regulatory fees and nuclear and
transmission systems maintenance. The Increase in depreciation
and amortization expense reflects additions to plant in service.
Income taxes decreased primarily due to the tax impact of the rate
refund (see Note 2F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements)
and to other decreases in income. Other taxes increased primarily
from higher property taxes caused by property additions and
Increased millage rates. In addition to the above, other taxes
increased due to increases in state license fees.
Other Income
Other income, net of income taxes, increased approximately
$14.7 million in 1993 primarily due to additional income from
Petroleum Resources related to higher natural gas prices and addi-
tional income resulting from the acquisition of NICOR in June 1993.
Interest Expense
• 1993 Interest on long-term debt increased approximately $5.6
million in 1993 compared to 1992 due to the Issuance of $72.4
million medium-term notes during the latter part of 1992 and $60
million medium-term notes in July 1993 to finance acquisitions of
natural gas reserves and the issuance of $200 million of SCE&G's
First Mortgage Bonds to finance utility construction. The resulting
increases more than offset the Interest savings resulting from the
redemption of $382 million of First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds
with the proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of First
Mortgage Bonds by SCE&G at lower interest rates.
• 1992 Interest on long-term debt increased approximately $4.4
million in 1992 compared to 1991 due to the Issuances of $145
million and $155 million of First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds on
July 24, 1991 and August 29, 1991, respectively, which more than
offset the decreases in interest expense resulting from the repayment
of debt and lower interest rates on remaining debt.
