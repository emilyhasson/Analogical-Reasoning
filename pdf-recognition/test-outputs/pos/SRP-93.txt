Byproducts from a floral foam manufactur-
ing plant currently disposed of in a landfill
may soon be helping fuel Sierra Pacific's
Valmy Station Power Plant. Mari Gilbert, a
plant engineer at Valmy, displays the foam
pellets which are being tested at the plant.
Test runs have shown the pellets to be an
efficient fuel.

The National Energy Policy Act
of 1992 accelerated this process by
further encouraging non-utility
electric generation companies, and
opening the door for open access
transmission of electricity to whole-
sale customers across a wide range of
geographic markets. The electric
industry stepped up its movement
toward eventual open buying at the
retail level. This has already
occurred in the natural gas
industry, where large
customers now regularly
contract for gas supplies
among competing gas
producers. Gas distribution compa-
nies are required to "wheel" or
transport this purchased energy to
the customers through the distribu-
tion company's pipelines.
The exclusive franchise utilities
have enjoyed for energy sales is
rapidly disappearing. In June,
Nevada became the first state to pass
legislation authorizing discounted
energy purchases and limited retail
electric wheeling under certain cir-
cumstances. Less restrictive policies
are sure to follow in Nevada and
other states. Utilities prepared to
compete and take advantage of
these new opportunities will thrive.
The Fastest Growing
State in the U.S.
The outlook for continuing
growth in sales of our energy prod-
ucts and services is encouraging
because of the robust economic
growth in Sierra Pacific's 50,000
square mile service territory.
Nevada has regained its position as
the state with the fastest growing
population in the nation. A study
