Dear Shareholder:
Two issues were successfully dealt with in 1997. They were continued focus on excellent
current performance and preparation for the future electric sales market.
Earnings for the year rose to $1.20 per share, up more than 4% and better than twice
the industry average; dividends were increased to $0.907 per share in February 1997 and
again in February 1998 to $0.94 per share; the stock price hit an all-time high of $28% and
we declared a three-for-two stock split to be effective January 12, 1998. Our total return in
1997 was over 25%. These are all reflections of our strong financial performance and capable
management team.
We are proud of these accomplishments when compared against the backdrop of
the energy industry, which is quite different from our own performance. In 1997, many energy
companies did not increase dividends, lost money in related and unrelated new business
ventures, and continuously changed their "vision". Our vision occurred more than fifteen years
ago, when we began preparing for a competitive energy environment. Namely, that we sell
a commodity and a commodity sells on price.
in 1997, the Ohio government began the initial steps toward opening the regulated
electricity environment. The issues are tough. They include tax restructuring, reliability of
electric service, recovery of invested capital and determining the time frame for deregulation
to occur.
We believe that many new attributes are necessary to be competitive and that size alone
will not determine profitability. Rather, the ability to quickly take advantage of opportunities in
the market place and those presented by governmental rules are keys to success.
We have been preparing for a change in the market and the rules under which we
do business for well over a decade. Our management team has focused on flexibility, both
operationally and financially. We experienced first hand in the natural gas business how
government can completely change a market. We learned that the ability to adapt quickly to

change is critical. Streamlined management and operations can become the critical factor in
profiting from change.
Our productivity and efficiency has historically been among the ten best in the country.
Our balance sheet is strong and we have the financial means necessary to move into a new
era. We are also a combination electric and natural gas company. This means we provide a
complete and competitively priced energy package for any customer. When combined with
natural gas and coal costs for electric generation that are near the lowest in the Midwest region,
our competitive advantage is really enhanced. We view the coming changes as opportunities.
The electricity sales market will be confused for quite some time to come. Basically, the
business will be like most others. Each state will have its own rules, making management focus
on fundamentals and overall flexibility paramount to success. To remain profitable, you need
competitive production costs, a solid distribution base and a positive customer service team.
We have these tools. We have the will to change, again and again as the market progresses
and the agility to do it quickly.
Your Board of Directors and the management team are dedicated to bringing you
excellent current returns while focusing on growing into the future. The formula for success
that we have and will continue to work on, is financial strength, preparation and focus.
Thank you for letting us work for you.
Best regards,

The DPL Mission
As the energy industry moves through transition, our goal remains unchanged. We will
continue to provide quality gas and electric service to our customers at competitive prices,
and earn a fair rate of return for our shareholders. By adhering to this long-time corporate
goal, we have established an industry leading operating and financial position. One sign
of DPL Inc.'s industry leadership is the ability to deliver solid results. We have the ability,
motivation and attitude to make results happen, not just plan for them. In an environment of
increasing market and price volatility it is team strength that ultimately prevails. With each
state embarking on its own path towards competition, uncertainty and risk in the industry will
increase. With our historical focus on strong financial and operating results, we are prepared
for the changes in the utility industry.

Key Strategic Objectives
Our blueprint for success and continued improvement combines several key elements. These
include maintaining our strong financial position, managing opportunities and risks, keeping
a strong customer focus, continuing industry leading operations and controlling costs. Our
successful completion of these objectives will translate into solid shareholder returns.
The restructuring and changing regulatory environment of the electric utility industry
continues. Companies are implementing very diverse strategies to deal with changing
regulatory policy. As in the past, there are several pending or proposed mergers that seek to
combine resources. In addition, several companies have chosen to sell off assets in response
to competition. Clearly, the gas and electric markets are moving toward a commodity-based
industry. This action supports one of the foundations of our operations that has been present
for many years. Specifically, that we are in the business of selling a commodity, and a
Since 1987, DP&L electric prices have declined 23%,
