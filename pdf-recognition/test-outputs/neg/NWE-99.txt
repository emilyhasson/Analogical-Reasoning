Just five years ago, more than 95 percent of our total
customer revenues were comprised of electric and gas
services from our regulated entities. Today, more than
90 percent of customer revenues come from
NorthWestern's partner entities that include nonregulated
service and solutions operations in growth-oriented
communications, heating, air conditioning, energy and
related sectors. Focusing on service and solutions
industries positions NorthWestern for tremendous future
growth and value creation opportunities as we enter the
new millennium.
CONCENTRATING ON SMALL
AND MID-MARKET CUSTOMERS
Although our line of services and solutions is diverse,
extensive and expanding, our strategies are concentrated
on providing residential and small- to mid-sized business
customers with superior value. This frequently
underserved customer segment represents the greatest
opportunities for growth, direct customer relationships,
customer retention and referrals, and operating margin.
We consider our relationships with our customers to be
the foundation and future of our success. We constantly
strive to enhance our customer relationships through
broadened service offerings, service and performance
guarantees, service standards, and customer satisfaction
measures. The customer knowledge we are gaining
enables us to strengthen our abilities to serve customers
better and in more unique ways.
STRENGTHENING OUR FOUNDATION OF
A WINNING CULTURE AND LASTING VALUES
Our culture is paramount to our long-term success;
it defines NorthWestern's partner entities and clarifies our
purpose for existence. Our values - Service Excellence,
Performance, Integrity, Respect, Innovation and
Teamwork - provide guidance and inspiration to all of the
people within our partner entities. We call our values the
NorthWestern SPIRIT. This is the winning foundation on
which we will build a rewarding future for our customers,
our team members and our shareholders.
SUPPORTED BY A TALENTED TEAM
In our service and solutions businesses, people make the
difference in achieving extraordinary success for our
customers. Reaching our vision of delivering the best in
service and solutions requires experienced,
knowledgeable, innovative and caring experts at all levels
throughout the NorthWestern partner entities.NorthWestern has a tradition of developing people from within NORTHWESTERN'S
our entities and seeking talented individuals from outside.
Throughout the NorthWestern partner entities, we support
and sponsor training, education and certification, encouraging
our people to reach their highest potential.
OUTSTANDING
PERFORMANCE
REFLECTS
The breadth and depth of our organization is a major
advantage for us and our culture provides the agility and
flexibility necessary to react quickly to opportunities as they
are presented. Our top priority is attracting and developing
the very best people for our fast-growing operations. We are
winning the competitive war for talent in our most critical
areas - leadership, customer care, technical operations and
strategic development.
PURSUING DISCIPLINED GROWTH PRINCIPLES
We have developed a highly disciplined balance of internal
growth combined with a long history of making successful
acquisitions. Our aggressive internal growth programs
target above-industry growth in each of our sectors
through an emphasis on new customer marketing as well
as superior customer relationship management processes
to serve our existing customers with innovative service and
solutions offerings.
Our acquisition and strategic development success stems
from a rigorous process for evaluating new strategies and
operations, including their opportunities and risks. We
focus on new opportunities that match our strategic vision,
fit our customer criteria, and have a proven management
team capable of attaining market leadership.
ACHIEVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
NorthWestern's outstanding long-term operating and
financial performance reflects the company's disciplined
strategic initiatives. We intend to produce balanced
earnings growth and strong cash flow that supports
superior value creation parameters. We also intend to
continue our investment in the growth of the NorthWestern
partner entities, through both internal development and
strategic acquisitions that make us more valuable to our
customers and our shareholders.
We continue to enhance our operational excellence by
bolstering productivity, efficiency and innovation by
capitalizing on the strengths of our leadership teams in our
field locations and our support functions. Our team-
oriented culture compels us to pursue opportunities for
working in concert and to leverage NorthWestern's

extensive capabilities in people resources, information
technology, finance, legal, customer strategies and
communications across our organizations for strategic
advantage.
Our success in executing our long-term strategies has
resulted in the best financial performance in the history of
the company during fiscal 1999. Based on our long- and
short-term growth and profitability, we were recently
recognized as a Platinum 400 company - a Forbes listing of
best-performing big corporations in America.
Our Board signaled their confidence in our financial
performance capabilities with an 8 percent dividend increase
in November, marking the 16th successive year of dividend
increases. We are optimistic about our plans to deliver
strong earnings and cash flow growth well into the future.
WE ARE WELL POSITIONED FOR A PROMISING FUTURE
We believe we are well positioned for extraordinary growth
and success. Our vision is bold, our strategies are sound, our
opportunities are rich and our people are the best in the
business. We again thank you, our shareholders, team
members and customers for your tremendous support and
contributions. Together we make a very strong team.

Today's residential or business customer takes certain conveniences for
granted. They expect that their lights will turn on when it is dark, that the
air conditioning will cool when it is hot, that the propane will be delivered
before it is needed, that the network performs reliably.
In today's fast-paced world, consumers want to spend their time on what
is important in their lives whether it is nurturing a family or building a
business. To ensure they receive what they expect and deserve,
NorthWestern's goal is not only to provide first-class customer service
but to fundamentally reinvent the entire customer service experience.
Customers know they can depend on NorthWestern's professional
service experts at any time. Our service guarantees provide security and
peace of mind. Customers also know they can trust us to deliver
innovative, time-saving and cost-effective solutions.
The secret of our service success? Our well-trained, talented, innovative
and resourceful people who are committed to delivering the best service
and solutions experience - any way, any where, any time.

PROBLEM
SOLVED
Homeowner Joe Montano and Adam Campbell,
a Blue Dot engineer in Los Angeles, examine a
recently installed high-efficiency furnace.
Desperate to relieve his allergies, Joe - who
works from home - replaced his entire
heating and air conditioning system two years
ago. Frustratingly, the allergies persisted until
he called on Blue Dot to reevaluate his home
and office environment.
After carefully considering the situation, Blue
Dot recommended a two-zone system with
new ducts and balancing dampers to regulate
the temperature between work and personal
space, plus an adjustable steam humidifier
and a HEPA filter to purify the air. They also
made the heating system more accessible by
removing it from a tight attic space and
suspending it from the garage ceiling.
Now Joe works comfortably from his home
office... allergy free.

Situated off Long Island's sandy strip of beaches, New York's Fire
Island is a quaint, isolated summer retreat. Visitors leave their
cars on the mainland and arrive by ferry. In the winter months
when vacationers teave the island, they leave their house keys
(and property) in the hands of CornerStone Propane. Since 1950,
the company has provided fuel for heating homes, pools and spas.
Propane is brought to the island by boat and then CornerStone
uses scooters to deliver the heavy cylinders to their customers.
CornerStone also offers the year-round residents, like joe
Cole (pictured here with CornerStone team member Douglas
Teague), peace of mind by providing a full range of home services,
including plumbing and heating, security and maintenance.

Knowing the dangers of the extreme weather in South
Dakota, NorthWestern Public Service teamed up with local
TV station KELO-TV to bring live Doppler 2000 radar to its
customers. The state-of-the-art system can zoom in on a
...specific storm cell, track its exact location and pinpoint
where the storm will land. NorthWestern team members,
like Richard Vandever, also use Doppler 2000 to predict
how weather may affect the company's operations.
TEL

In Yankton, South Dakota, NorthWestern and KELO-TV put
Doppler's WeatherNet education system into school
classrooms as a community service. Children find up-to-
the-minute local temperature, wind speed, humidity and
barometric pressure on their classroom computers.
WeatherNet curriculum guides help teachers reinforce
science skills and helps children learn how weather works.

UPGRADE
Expanets has a five-year track
record with Cheap Tickets, one
of the nation's leading
distributors of discounted
airfares. Cheap Tickets sells
directly to consumers through
their Internet site, toll-free
number and retail stores.
Their four call centers process
over 20 million calls a year.
Cheap Tickets needed a way to
control the trafficking of their
call volumes and to provide
their agents with immediate
and automatic access to
customer records. In order to
stay competitive, a major
upgrade was needed... and
fast. The call center at
Colorado Springs was the
most critical.
In just three days, the
Expanets team, led by System
Engineer Mark McGrath,
completed all programming
and testing by working round-
the-clock and through the
weekend. The following day,
the team moved on site to
Colorado to complete
installation. Just nine days
later at midnight, the old call
center system was dismantled
and by 10:00 a.m. the next
morning, all 328 Cheap
Tickets agents were online
trouble free.

DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
NORTHWESTERN CORPORATION
NorthWestern Corporation ("Corporation") is a provider of
services and solutions to customers across North America. The
Corporation provides electric and natural gas service to Midwestern
customers through our energy division, NorthWestern Public Service.
In addition, the Corporation holds interests in Blue Dot Services Inc.
("Blue Dot"), a national provider of heating, ventilation, air condi-
tioning, plumbing and related services ("HVAC"); CornerStone
Propane Partners, L.P. (NYSE:CNO) ("CornerStone"), the nation's
fourth largest retail propane distributor and also is a wholesale
distributor of energy-related commodities; and Expanets, Inc.
("Expanets"), a national provider of networked communications and
data solutions to mid-sized business customers. The Corporation is
also engaged in other service and nonenergy-related businesses.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS
Consolidated earnings for 1999 on common shares were
$37.9 million, an increase of $10.8 million or 40% over 1998
earnings of $27.1 million. The diluted earnings per share increased
13% from $1.44 in 1998 to $1.62, primarily from the additional invest-
ments in the HVAC and communications business segments in 1999
along with the full year impact of acquisitions made during 1998.
Earnings per share is reflective of the aforementioned
40% consolidated earnings improvement, after allowing for the
24% increase in average shares outstanding from 1998 to 1999.
Consolidated earnings for 1998 were $3.7 million more than 1997
earnings of $23.4 million, reflecting the initiation of our investments in
the HVAC and communications segments in 1998. Diluted
earnings per share in 1998 of $1.44 increased 10% over 1997
diluted earnings per share of $1.31 due to the increased earnings
offset partially by the 5% increase in average shares outstanding
in 1998.
Dividends increased from an annual rate of $1.03 per share to
$1.11 per share in November 1999, a 7.8% increase. Dividends were
increased by 6.2% in 1998 to $1.03 per share from $.97 per share in
1997. Future dividend policy will be contingent upon the Board's evalu-
ation of the Corporation's financial condition and competitive changes
in the industries in which the Corporation operates.
CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS
In reviewing the consolidated operating results, the reader is
reminded that there is disparity in financial operating relationships
amongst the segments, particularly as it relates to the wholesale
propane operations. Furthermore, the propane, HVAC and communi.
cations segments experienced significant acquisition growth during
1998 and 1999, along with related infrastructure development.
Accordingly, a meaningful understanding of the operating results
must include a thorough review of the segment information discus-
sion which follows.
Operating revenues in 1999 rose to $3.0 billion compared to
1998 revenues of $1.2 billion, representing an increase of 153%.
The majority of the increase, approximately $1.5 billion, was due to
the increase in revenues generated by the propane segment, both
through internal growth and acquisitions, of which approximately
95% of the increase was from the wholesale operations. The
propane growth was combined with continued growth in HVAC and
14 NorthWestern Corporation
communications segments, both internal and through acquisitions,
and improved performance in the natural gas and electric segments.
HVAC and communications acquisitions contributed to the increase
with a full year impact of operations from acquisitions completed in
1998 and partial year impact of new acquisitions in 1999. Revenues
for 1998 increased $269.1 million over 1997 to $1.2 billion.
HVAC and communications segments acquisitions combined
contributed to 93% of the increase.
Cost of sales in 1999 of $2.5 billion increased $1.6 billion over
1998, primarily due to the propane segment. The $1.4 billion
increase in propane reflects principally the increased wholesale
activity in that segment (wholesale sales experience lower gross
margins than retail sales), which contributed substantially all of the
segment increase, Expansions through internal growth and
continued acquisitions in the HVAC and communications segments
contributed to the remainder of the increase as the other segments
remained relatively stable. Cost of sales for 1998 increased
$144.7 million over 1997 costs of $695.0 million. The acquisitions in
the communications and HVAC segments added $70.0 million and
$75.8 million, respectively, offsetting the decline in electric and
natural gas costs resulting from weather fluctuations.
Gross margins in 1999 increased, rising from $347.4 million or
29% (50% excluding wholesale propane) in 1998 to $536.6 million or
18% (47% excluding wholesale propane) in 1999, principally due to
growth in the HVAC, communications and propane segments, which
caused the increase in absolute terms while the aforementioned
increase in wholesale revenues was the primary cause of the
decreased gross margin percentage. Gross margins in 1998 of
$347.4 million increased $124.4 million over 1997 margins. The
growth from the HVAC and communications segments contributed
a combined $105.5 million to gross margins. The propane
segment provided the remainder of the increase as the other
segments remained relatively constant.
Operating expenses reflect the growth in the segments and the
costs associated with business expansion. Expenses rose 63% from
$279.9 million in 1998 to $457.0 million in 1999. Operating
expenses during 1999 rose at a rate less than the increase in
revenues due principally to the aforementioned increase in whole-
sale propane revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses
account for the majority of operating expenses and increased
$152.5 million over 1998. The HVAC and communications segments
were the principal components of the increase as their expenses
increased a combined $114.0 million. This was due to a full year of
expenses for 1998 acquisitions, the partial year impact of 1999
quisitions and incurrence of additional infrastructure costs to
support the increased size of business operations. Depreciation and
amortization expense rose $24.7 million to $68.3 million in 1999.
This increase is reflective of the full year of depreciation and amorti.
zation expense from acquisitions made in 1998, along with the
partial year impact of 1999 acquisitions in the HVAC, communica-
tions and propane segments. Operating expenses rose 71% over
1997 expenses of $164.0 million to $279.9 million in 1998. Selling,
general and administrative expenses grew $103.4 million in 1998
primarily from the growth in the HVAC and communications
segments. Propane segment growth was responsible for the
remainder of the increase. Depreciation and amortization increased
$12.4 million from $31,2 million in 1997 as a result of the growth in
HVAC, communications and propane segmentConsolidated operating income improved 18% over 1998 to
$79.6 million for 1999. The increase is a result of the aforemen-
tioned propane, communications and HVAC business segments
growth in both gross and operating margins. Operating income in
1998 increased $8.5 million over 1997 income of $59.0 million and
is attributable to the HVAC and communications segments offset by
decreases in the propane, electric and natural gas segments due
mainly from adverse weather patterns in 1998.
Propane
CornerStone provides retail propane to business and residential
customers in the U.S. and wholesale energy-related commodities to
businesses in the U.S. and Canada. The Corporation owned an effec-
tive combined 30% interest of CornerStone, comprised of general
partner interests and subordinated units, as of December 31, 1999.
Retail propane is mainly sold for heating purposes and, as a
result, sales are extremely sensitive to weather. The coldest months
are during the first and fourth quarters of the year, and are, therefore,
the largest revenue and profit generating months. The weather for
1999 averaged 12% warmer than normal in CornerStone's main
market areas, negatively impacting sales volumes and revenues.
While weather factors generally measure the directional impact of
temperatures on the business, other factors such as product prices
and geographic mix can also impact sales.
Revenues for 1999 increased $1.5 billion over 1998 revenues
of $767.7 million, primarily due to expansion of the wholesale
business, which accounted for 95% of the increase in revenues..
This expansion is attributable to internal growth and the acquisi-
tions of Propane Continental, Inc. ("PCI"), which had retail and
wholesale operations, and two wholesale companies. These
acquisitions, which were completed in late 1998 and during
1999, combined with organic growth, contributed to more than
tripling the size of the wholesale operations. Retail sales
increased 30% from $234.6 million in 1998 to $303.9 million in
1999. Of the $69.3 million increase, approximately 79% was due to
1998 and 1999 acquisitions and the remainder to internal growth.
Retail volumes increased accordingly with retail gallons rising from
231.4 million to 281.6 million or a 22% increase. Total revenues in
1998 showed a modest increase of $24.7 million over 1997,
reflecting the warmer than normal weather and the low growth in
wholesale activity. Retail revenues in 1998 decreased $9.0 million
versus 1997 as a result of lower product costs combined with warmer
than normal weather partially offset by increased volumes to a larger
customer base. Retail volumes increased from 220.1 million gallons in
1997 to 231.4 million gallons in 1998. Wholesale revenues increased
$33.7 million or 7% in 1998 due to internal growth.
Cost of sales increased from $618.8 million in 1998 to $2.0 billion
in 1999. These statistics reflect the increased wholesale activity as
well as the impact of retail and wholesale acquisitions closed in
1998 and 1999. As noted above, wholesale revenues increased
dramatically, but there are substantially higher costs associated with
wholesale sales. Cost of sales for wholesale business in 1999
increased $1,4 billion to $1.9 billion, a rise of 270% versus the
related sales increase of 264%. High crude oil prices increased the
price of energy-related commodities in 1999 which caused the
cost of sales to increase at a slightly higher pace than revenues.
Retail costs grew $29.5 million from $103.6 million in 1998 to
$133.1 million 1999. This increase of 28% is due to the increased

volume of business from new acquisitions and internal growth in
1999 and reflects margin improvement relative to the 30% increase
in retail revenues. Total cost of sales in 1998 increased $6.4 million
over 1997 to $618.8 million, reflecting costs associated with the
increased wholesale activity in 1998 partially offset by the lower
product prices for retail and wholesale sales.
Gross margins in 1999 increased $58.7 million over 1998.
Although wholesale activity contributed the majority of the increase
in revenues and cost of sales, the retail business accounts for
approximately 82% of the total gross margins and for 68% of the
increase as a result of the higher inherent margins in retail sales.
Conversely, the significant increase in the relatively lower margin
wholesale business has reduced overall margin percentages.
Wholesale margins grew $18.8 million, more than doubling 1998
margins, a reflection of the wholesale acquisitions and internal
growth noted above. Gross margins in 1998 increased $18.2 million
over 1997 to $149.0 million. This 14% increase was caused by a
larger decline in retail cost of sales over revenues offsetting warm
weather and acquisitions.
Operating expenses for 1999 increased approximately 37% or
$46.0 million from 1998. Selling, general and administrative
expenses for 1999 were $137.9 million, an increase of $32.4 million
or 31% over 1998. This increase resulted from acquisitions, which
added $23.5 million in expenses, along with additional costs
incurred necessary to support the internal growth. Depreciation and
amortization increased from 1998 expenses of $20.2 million to
$33.8 million. 1999 expenses reflect a full year of expense associated
with the 1998 acquisitions as well as some additional costs from 1999
acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses in 1998
were $15.2 million higher than 1997 expenses of $90.3 million. This
increase was due to internal growth as well as the impact of acquisi-
tions. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million
due to the depreciation and amortization of established operations as
well as some additional expense from acquisitions.
Operating income in 1999 of $36.0 million is a $12.7 million or
55% increase over 1998, reflecting revenue growth that outpaced
directly related cost of sales and the added expense from expanding
operations, however, overall profitability was negatively impacted by
weather. Operating income in 1998 decreased $300,000 from 1997
operating income of $23.6 million. The decrease was attributable
mainly to warmer than normal weather and normal fluctuations in
overall operating expenses.
Electric
Electricity is generated, transmitted and distributed to over
56,000 customers in South Dakota by NorthWestem Public Service, a
division of the Corporation. Electricity is used year round by individuals
and businesses, but use is dependent upon the weather as overall
demand is higher during the summer months for air conditioning.
Electric revenues increased 7% in 1999 from $78.4 million in
1998 to $83.9 million for 1999. Retail electric revenues reflected a
modest growth despite a 1% decline in total mwh usage and a
slightly cooler summer season. The growth is a result of slight
increases in power costs and a customer base increase of 2% in
1999. Wholesale revenues helped to minimize the effects of cooler
summer weather with sales increasing $2.5 million over 1998 to
reach $6.8 million. Wholesale mwh were 61% higher in 1999 as a
result of higher off-system sales. 1998 revenues increased $1.7 million

DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
over 1997 revenues to $78.4 million. This increase was caused
primarily by increased wholesale activity as retail revenues increased
only $.6 million while wholesale revenues increased $1.1 million.
Cost of sales for 1999 grew $3.1 million to $18.5 million. As
noted above, wholesale activity was up substantially in 1999 and
is reflected in the increased costs. Cost of sales for wholesale
electricity increased $1.0 million over 1998 costs of $2.3 million.
Retail cost of sales grew by 15% due to increased sales activity and
power costs adjustments from prior years. 1998 cost of sales of
$15.4 million were reflective of a 6% increase over 1997 cost of
sales of $14.6 million. This increase was due almost entirely to the
increased wholesale activity in 1998. Retail cost of sales remained
relatively flat with only a 2% increase.
Gross margins in 1999 of $65.5 million reflect a 4% growth over
1998 gross margins of $63.0 million. The 4% growth in gross
margins is slightly less than the aforementioned 7% revenue
increase due to the increase in wholesale revenues, which carry a
lower *gross margin. Gross margins for 1998 grew by $800,000 over
1997. Both increased wholesale activity and a proportional increase
in retail revenues and cost of sales caused the rise.
Operating expenses decreased slightly for the electric segment
from 1998 expenses of $37.4 million to $36.7 million due to
efficiency improvements. Expenses in 1998 were $2.4 million higher
than 1997 expenses. The change was due to slight increases in
administrative expenses for salaries and benefits.
Operating income for 1999 of $28.8 million reflects a
12% increase over 1998 operating income. This increase resulted
from an increase in gross margins (excess of revenues over cost of
sales) due to price adjustments, increased customer base, increased
wholesale revenues and the slight decrease in operating expenses.
1998 operating income declined $1.6 million from 1997 operating
income of $27.2 million. The decline reflected the effects of the
increased operating expenses over gross margins that experienced
lower growth.
Natural Gas
Natural gas revenues for the Corporation are predominately
derived from residential and commercial sales for heating
purposes to approximately 80,000 customers in South Dakota and
Nebraska. This reliance upon heating as a primary use makes the
segment extremely sensitive to weather patterns during the winter
heating season.
Revenues in 1999 increased $1.0 million or 2% over
1998 revenues, a reflection of the comparable heating seasons
between the years, stable natural gas supply prices, and a static
customer base. Heating degree-days and average temperatures
during the heating seasons for 1999 and 1998 were virtually
unchanged, being approximately 13% below normal in both years.
Revenues in 1998 were $67.2 million, a decrease of $10.3 million
or 13% from 1997 revenues. The decline was due to a warmer
than average heating season. First quarter 1998 temperatures
were 18% warmer than 1997 and fourth quarter temperatures
were 14% warmer.
Cost of sales also remained stable in 1999, with a slight decrease
of $150,000 from 1998 to $47.1 million. This stability is a reflection
of the comparable weather patterns between the years and the
absence of market price fluctuations for natural gas supply. in 1998,
natural gas cost of sales decreased $7.8 milli or 14% from 1997.
16
North Western Corporation
This decrease was due to unusually warm temperatures and
resulting decreased revenues, as noted above.
Gross margins for 1999 were $21.2 million, an increase of
$1.2 million or 6% over 1998. The increase is a product of slightly
lower cost of sales and an increase in revenues over 1998. As noted
above, weather pattems were comparable between the years,
resulting in little change in cost of sales or revenues. 1998 gross
margins were 11% lower than 1997, falling to $20.0 million from
$22.5 million in 1997. This decline was a reflection of the impact of
warmer weather in 1998, which decreased both revenues and the
associated costs, as noted above.
Operating expenses in 1999 increased slightly from $14.8 million
to $15.2 million as a result of normal business fluctuations.
Operating expenses in 1998 were $500,000 less than 1997 expenses
of $15.3 million, reflective of the stable business operations.
Natural gas operating income increased 14% over 1998 to
$6.0 million. This increase is due to the slight rise in gross margins,
which exceeded the increase in expenses. The effects of warm
weather adversely impacted 1998 operating income. 1998 operating
income decreased $2.0 million from 1997 to $5.2 million. The
weather caused lower revenues and cost of sales, partially offset by a
decrease in administrative and other overhead costs, the net of
which resulted in lower income.
Communications
Expanets was formed in 1998 to provide integrated communica-
tions, data and network services to business customers. As of
December 31, 1999, the Corporation has invested $152.0 million in
Expanets to acquire 26 companies. During 1999, the Corporation
invested $43.3 million in Expanets in connection with the acquisi-
tion of eight companies representing approximately $37.8 million
in revenues ($76 million on a pro forma annualized basis).
Revenues in 1999 were $294.9 million, representing an increase
of $168.4 million or 133% over 1998 revenues. The inclusion of a full
year of revenues for companies acquired during 1998 was the
principal driver of the increase combined with internal growth and
the partial year impact of companies acquired in 1999.
Cost of sales for 1999 increased $98.9 million or 141% over
1998 costs of $70.0 million. A full year of operations for companies
acquired in 1998, combined with internal growth, accounted for
$72,1 million of the increase. Companies acquired in 1999 accounted
for the remaining increase.
Gross margins for 1999 increased to $126.0 million, an increase
of $70.0 million or 123% as compared to 1998. This increase is
due to a full year of operations for companies acquired in
1998 combined with internal growth and is in line with the revenue
growth. The partial year impact of 1999 acquisitions accounted for
$11.0 million of the increase in gross margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of $102.5 million
in 1999 increased $56.8 million or 124% as compared to 1998
expenses of $45.7 million. The full year of operations for
companies acquired in 1998 combined with internal growth
were the primary contributors of the increase and is slightly
less than the growth in revenues. Corporate expenses
increased in 1999 as compared to 1998 to build infrastructure
in supporting the high growth of communications operations.
The partial year impact of companies acquired in 1999
accounted for $9.2 million of the increase. Depreciation andamortization expense increased to $10.5 million in 1999 as
compared to $4.9 million in 1998. The increase is due princi-
pally to the full year of expense for companies acquired in
1998, with 1999 acquisitions for the period owned contributing
$1.0 million of the increase.
Operating income in 1999 increased $7.1 lion or
121% over 1998 operating income of $5.9 million. The increase
represents a full year of operations for the companies acquired in
1998 combined with internal growth and the partial year impact of
new acquisitions in 1999 partially offset by increased infrastruc-
ture building at the corporate level,
HVAC
Blue Dot, established in late 1997, provides heating, ventilation,
air conditioning, plumbing and related services to residential and
business customers. As of December 31, 1999, the Corporation has
invested $155.4 million for the acquisition of 62 companies. During
1999, $68.0 million was invested for the acquisition of 34 companies
representing approximately $68.2 million in revenues ($136 million
on a pro forma annualized basis).
Operating revenues increased $168.9 million or 135% over
1998 revenues of $124.9 million, resulting primarily from the
inclusion of a full year of revenues for companies acquired in 1998
combined with internal growth and the partial year impact of
companies acquired in 1999.
Cost of sales for 1999 increased $105.4 million or 139% to
$181.3 million, primarily due to a full year of operations for
companies acquired in 1998 combined with internal growth. The
partial year impact of companies acquired in 1999 accounted for
$41.2 million of the increase in cost of sales.
Gross margins in 1999 grew to $112.5 million, an increase of
$63.4 million or 129% over 1998. The full year of activity for 1998
acquisitions and internal growth were the primary contributors of the
growth. The partial year impact of 1999 acquisitions accounted for
$27.0 million of the increase in gross margins.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
$57.2 million or 146% as compared to 1998 expenses of
$39.3 million, primarily due to the full year of operations from
companies acquired in 1998 combined with internal growth and
increases in corporate resource infrastructure to support the rapidly
growing HVAC organization. The addition of 34 companies during
1999 and the additional corporate resources necessary to handle
the continual expansion of the business accounted for 32% of the
expenses in 1999. Depreciation and amortization expense
increased $5.0 million as compared to 1998 due primarily to a
full year of depreciation and amortization expense for companies
acquired in 1998 combined with additional partial year expense
from 1999 acquisitions.
Operating income of $7.3 million for 1999 increased $1.1 million
or 18% as compared to 1998 operating income of $6.2 million,
principally due to a full year of operations for companies acquired in
1998 combined with internal growth and the partial year impact
of 1999 acquisitions offset in part by the increased corporate
infrastructure costs.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
Revenues decreased $5.3 million from 1998 revenues of
$22.5 million, principally due to the sale of the Corporation's
ownership interest in Lucht Inc. ("Lucht") in November 1998,
offset partially by a full year of operations from an acquisition
combined with internal growth. Revenues in 1998 were
$1.7 million higher than 1997 revenues. This increase was due
to internal growth within the businesses.
Cost of sales increased in 1999 to $13.4 million, an increase of
$800,000 over 1998. Costs increased due to a different product and
service mix combined with internal growth partially offset by the sale
of Lucht. Cost of sales in 1998 were $12.6 million or $500,000 less
than 1997. This decrease resulted partially from the sale of Lucht in
November 1998 offset by internal growth.
Gross margins were $6.1 million less in 1999 as compared to
1998 due to the different mix of service lines provided, of which Lucht
was not a part of in 1999. 1998 gross margins were $9.9 million or
$2.3 million higher than 1997 gross margins. The increase was a
result of internal growth.
Total operating expenses increased $6.7 million to $15.2 million
in 1999 as compared to $8.5 million in 1998. The increase is a result
of additional personnel and associated costs principally for the
corporate office, to better support and leverage current and poten-
tial growth strategies, combined with a different mix of service
businesses. 1998 expenses were $8.5 million compared to
$6.6 million in 1997. The $1.9 million increase was a result of
higher costs principally at Lucht.
Operating income decreased $12.8 million as compared to
1998. This is a reflection of the aforementioned infrastructure growth
of the corporate office combined with the sale of the Lucht.
Operating income for 1998 was $1.3 million, which was an increase
of $.3 million over 1997. The increase was due to the slight growth in
gross margins offset by the increase in operating expenses princi-
pally from Lucht.
Other Income Statement Items
Interest expense rose in 1999 to $53.2 million, a 48% increase
over 1998, due to additional expense incurred in 1999 as a result of
the November 1998 debt offering of $105 million by the
Corporation and increased expense from propane's additional
nonrecourse borrowings in 1998 and 1999 to fund acquisitions
and general corporate purposes. 1998 interest expense of
$35.9 million was an increase of $4.4 million over 1997 expense.
Nonrecourse propane working capital and acquisition borrowings
were the primary reasons for the increase.
Investment income and other increased from $5.7 million in
1998 to $9.8 million in 1999. Investment of excess proceeds from
the November 1998 equity and debt offerings was the primary
contributor to the increase, 1998 investment income and other was
$5.9 million less than 1997 investment income and other of
$11.6 million. The decrease was principally due to utilization of
funds for Expanets and Blue Dot acquisitions rather than investments.
Income taxes in 1999 of $14.5 million are $3.3 million or
29% greater than 1998 tax expense of $11.2 million. This is directly
related to the growth in HVAC and communications segments and
the consequential increase in taxable income and nondeductible
goodwill amortization. Income taxes between 1997 and 1998
remained relatively stable with an increase of only $.1 million over
1997 to $11.2 million.

AND ANALYSIS
Changes in minority interest are a direct result of the perfor-
mance of the HVAC, communications and propane segments and
represents the portion of the net income or loss after preferred
dividends related to the Corporation's investments in Blue Dot and
Expanets and earnings attributable to the ComerStone public
common unitholders, which are allocable to other equity holders of
the applicable minority interests. Minority interest losses were
$22.9 million in 1999 compared to $4.2 million in 1998. The HVAC
and communications segments are principally responsible for the
increase, as net losses after preferred dividends were $10.4 million
and $14.4 million, respectively, offset partially by the propane
segment minority interests. Minority interest losses of $4.2 million in
1998 increased by $5.9 million over 1997, which is directly attribut-
able to the formation of the HVAC and communications segments
offset in part by the propane segment minority interests.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
OPERATING ACTIVITIES
Cash flows from operating activities increased to $71.7 million
in 1999 versus $69.9 million in 1998. The increase is due to
growing operations at all of the Corporation's businesses, partially
offset by increased working capital needs of the Blue Dot and
Expanets operations. Cash flows from operations, combined with
proceeds from long-term debt offerings, short-term borrowings and
excess cash from 1998 financing transactions provided the funds
necessary for general business purposes and the continued acquisi-
tion, growth and maintenance activities in 1999. The Corporation
held $125.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securi-
ties at December 31, 1999, and $157.3 million and $108.6 million
at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. These cash and
investment balances, combined with available lines of credit, provide
the resources necessary to support continued business operations.
INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES
The main focus of the Corporation's investment activities for
1999 was the continued strategic growth and development of
Blue Dot and Expanets. To enable the Corporation to continue
these investment strategies and help provide funding for general
business purposes, $11.0 million of commercial paper and
$58.0 million of the line of credit were drawn and outstanding at
December 31, 1999. The Corporation retired $5.0 million of
6.99% series general mortgage bonds in 1999. The Corporation's
unused lines of credit are $125.5 million at December 31, 1999,
CornerStone issued $45.0 million of Senior Notes in June 1999
to help fund acquisitions and provide funds for general business use.
In addition, ComerStone had $9.2 million outstanding from their
working capital portion of the Bank Credit Facility and no outstanding
borrowings on the acquisitions portion at December 31, 1999. The
CornerStone Bank Credit Facility provides for combined working
capital and acquisition borrowings of up to $110 million. This
Facility is subject to certain covenants and other limitations.
CornerStone's combined outstanding working capital and acquisition
borrowings at December 31, 1998, were $1.7 million. Blue Dot's
Credit Facility provides for up to $135.0 million to fund acquisitions
and for general business purposes. The Facility is subject to certain
covenants and various other limitations. Blue Dot had $28.2 million
outstanding at December 31, 1999, and no borrowings outstanding
as of December 31, 1998. Expanets has $14.7 million outstanding at
18
North Western Corporation
December 31, 1999, from their $15.0 million line of credit. The
funds have been used for general business use and to help fund
acquisitions. At December 31, 1998, $8.5 million was outstanding.
All debt of Blue Dot, CornerStone and Expanets is nonrecourse to
the Corporation.
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
The Corporation's primary capital requirements include funding
the growth of its business segments, maintenance and expansion
programs; the funding of debt and preferred stock retirements;
sinking fund requirements; the funding of its corporate development
and investment activities; payment of common dividends; and the
distributions to propane common unitholders.
Maintenance capital expenditure plans are subject to
continual review and may be revised as a result of changing
economic conditions, variation in sales, investment opportunities
and other factors. Expenditures for maintenance capital activities
for 1999, 1998 and 1997 were $32.6 million, $22.6 million and
$22.4 million, respectively, Consolidated maintenance capital
expenditures for 2000 and 2001 are estimated to be $36.9 million
and $38.0 million, respectively.
Capital requirements for the mandatory retirement of long-
term debt totaled $12.3 million, $7.8 million and $1.2 million for
the years ended 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. It is expected
that such mandatory retirements for the recourse debt will
be $5.0 million in 2000, $5.0 million in 2001 and $63.0 million
in 2002. Future retirements of nonrecourse debt will be
$19.2 million in 2000, $18.0 million in 2001, $33.4 million
in 2002, $45.7 million in 2003 and $44.2 million in 2004. The
Corporation anticipates that existing investment and marketable
securities, internally generated cash flows and available external
financing will be sufficient to meet future capital requirements.
The Corporation will continue to review the economics of retiring
or refunding remaining long-term debt and preferred stock to
minimize long-term financing costs. The Corporation may continue to
make investments in Blue Dot and Expanets. Also, the Corporation
may make other significant acquisition investments in related indus-
tries that might require the Corporation to raise additional equity
and/or incur debt financings, which are therefore subject to certain
risks and uncertainties.
COMPETITION AND BUSINESS RISK
NorthWestern and its partner entities are leading providers of
value-added, integrated services and solutions to over one million
residential and business customers nationwide. Our strategy will
continue to focus on the expansion of our existing initiatives,
both through internal growth and acquisitions and through the integra.
tion of other value-added services. We also intend to seek investment
apportunities in other existing or emerging growth industries within
the service and solutions sector. While these strategic development
and acquisition activities can involve increased risk, we believe they
offer the potential for enhanced investment retums. The Corporation's
growth strategy will be subject to certain risks and uncertainties,
including the future availability of market capital to fund development
and acquisitions, our ability to develop new growth initiatives, our
responses to increased competition, our ability to attract, retain and
train skilled team members, our ability to develop national service
brands in our business sectors, govemmental regulations and general
economic conditions, some of which factors are discussed in furtherdetail below. Our acquisition activities involve the risks of identifying
suitable acquisition candidates, successfully integrating and managing
acquired companies, including addressing the adequacy and efficiency
of information systems, business processes and related support
functions and retaining acquired customer bases. Our ability to
generate internal growth in our businesses will depend in part on our
ability to retain and expand our customer base through effective
marketing and promotional activities and the introduction of expanded
service offerings. The Corporation has taken and continues to take
steps to address and mitigate such risks. There are no assurances that
such efforts will be sufficient to meet the future needs of the
Corporation. Future changes in accounting rules and regulations,
particularly those related to purchase accounting, could also have a
material impact upon the Corporation's future financial statement
presentation, results from operations and financial position.
PROPANE
The retail propane business is a margin-based business in which
gross profits depend on the excess of sales prices over propane
supply costs. Consequently, CornerStone's profitability will be sensi-
tive to changes in wholesale propane prices. Propane is a commodity,
the market price of which can be subject to volatile changes in
response to changes in supply or other market conditions. In both the
retail and wholesale businesses, CornerStone engages in hedging of
product cost and supply through common hedging practices pursuant
to risk management policies monitored by management. As it may
not be possible to immediately pass on to customers rapid increases
in the wholesale cost of propane, such increases could reduce
CornerStone's gross profits.
Weather conditions have a significant impact on propane
demand for both heating and agricultural purposes. The majority of
CornerStone's customers rely heavily on propane as a heating fuel.
Actual weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year,
significantly affecting CornerStone's financial performance.
Furthermore, variations in weather in one or more regions in which
CornerStone operates can significantly affect the total volumes sold
by CornerStone and the margins realized on such sales and, conse-
quently, CornerStone's results of operations. These conditions may
also impact CornerStone's ability to meet various debt covenant
requirements, which could adversely affect CornerStone's ability to
pay common and subordinated unit distributions and fund future
growth and acquisitions,
Propane competes with other sources of energy, some of which
are less costly for equivalent energy value. Propane distributors
compete for customers against suppliers of electricity, fuel oil and
natural gas, principally on the basis of price, service, availability and
portability. Electricity is a competitor of propane, but propane gener-
ally enjoys a competitive price advantage over electricity for space
heating, water heating and cooking. Propane serves as an alternative
to natural gas in rural and suburban areas where natural gas is
unavailable or portability of product is required. Natural gas is gener-
ally a less expensive source of energy than propane, although in areas
where natural gas is available, propane is used for certain industrial
and commercial applications. The gradual expansion of the nation's
natural gas s distribution systems has resulted in the availability of
natural gas in some areas that previously depended upon propane.
However, natural gas pipelines are not present in many regions of the
country where propane is sold heating and cooking purposes.
MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
CornerStone's profitability is affected by the competition for
customers among all participants in the retail propane business.
Some of ComerStone's competitors are larger or have greater financial
resources than ComerStone. Should a competitor attempt to increase
market share by reducing prices, CornerStone's financial condition
and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
In addition, propane competes with other sources of energy, some of
which may be less costly per equivalent energy value.
ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS
The electric and natural gas industries continue to undergo
numerous transformations, and the Corporation is operating in an
increasingly competitive marketplace. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission ("FERC"), which regulates interstate and wholesale
electric transmissions, has issued final rules designed to open up
transmission grids and mandate owners of transmission assets to
allow others equal access to utility transmission systems and prompts
the formation of regional transmission organizations ("RTOs") to
control and operate interstate transmission facilities. Various state
regulatory bodies are supporting initiatives to redefine the electric
energy market and are experimenting with retail wheeling, which
gives some retail customers the ability to choose their supplier of
electricity. These and other developments are expected to increase
competition in the wholesale and retail electricity markets. The poten-
tial for continued unbundling of customer services exists, allowing
customers to buy their own electricity and natural gas on the open
market and having it delivered by the local utility.
The Corporation's future financial performance will be dependent
on the effective execution of operating strategies to address a more
competitive and changing energy marketplace. The Corporation is
exploring new energy products and services, utilizing new technolo-
gies, centralizing activities to improve efficiency and customer
responsiveness and business processes are being reengineered to
apply best-practices methodologies.
Weather conditions have a significant impact on electric and
natural gas demand for heating and cooling purposes. Actual
weather conditions can vary substantially from year to year, signifi-
cantly affecting the Corporation's financial performance.
Natural gas is a commodity that can be subject to volatile
changes in price. The Corporation engages in hedging of product cost
and supply through common hedging practices pursuant to risk
management policies monitored by management.
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Corporation complies with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 ("SFAS 71"), "Accounting for
the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." SFAS 71 provides for the
financial reporting requirements of the Corporation's regulated
electric and natural gas operations, which requires specific
accounting treatment of certain costs and expenses that are related
to the Corporation's regulated operations. Criteria that could give rise
to the discontinuance of SFAS 71 include 1) increasing competition
that restricts the Corporation's ability to establish prices to recover
specific costs and 2) a significant change in the manner in which
rates are set by regulators from cost-based regulation to another
form of regulation. The Corporation periodically reviews these criteria
to ensure the continuing application of SFAS 71 is appropriate.
Based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions
that are expected to impact future cost recovery, the Corporation
North Western Corporation
19MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS
believes that its regulatory assets, including those related to genera-
tion, are probable of future recovery. This evaluation of recovery must
be updated for any change which might occur in the Corporation's
current regulatory environment.
HVAC
The markets served by Blue Dot for residential and commercial
heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing and related services
are highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in these
segments of the industry are 1) the timeliness, reliability and quality
of services provided, 2) the range of products and services provided,
3) name recognition and market share and 4) pricing. Many of
Blue Dot's competitors in the HVAC business are small, owner-
operated companies typically located and operated in a single
geographic area. Certain of these smaller competitors may have lower
overhead cost structures and, consequently, may be able to charge
lower rates for their services. There are a small number of larger
national companies engaged in providing residential and commercial
services in the service lines in which Blue Dot intends to focus. Future
competition in both the residential and commercial service lines may
be encountered from other newly formed or existing public or private
service companies with aggressive acquisition and marketing
programs, from HVAC equipment manufacturers, the unregulated
business segments of regulated gas and electric utilities, or newly
deregulated utilities in those industries entering into various service
areas. Certain of Blue Dot's competitors may have greater financial
resources to finance acquisition and internal growth opportunities
and may be willing to pay higher prices than Blue Dot for acquisition
opportunities. Blue Dot's business is subject to seasonal variations
in certain areas of its service lines, with demand for residential
HVAC services generally higher in the second and third quarters. HVAC
systems are subject to various environmental regulations, and certain
local, state or federal laws may impose licensing standards on techni-
cians. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in
which Blue Dot operates will not change significantly in the future.
COMMUNICATIONS
The market served by Expanets in the communications, data
services and network solutions industry is a highly competitive
market. The principal competitive factors include 1) market accept-
ance of the products, services and technology solutions Expanets
provides, 2) pending and future legislation affecting the communica-
tions and data industry, 3) name recognition and market share, and
4) Expanets' ability to provide integrated communications and data
solutions for customers in a dynamic industry. Many of Expanets'
competitors in the communications business are generally small,
owner-operated companies typically located and operated in a single
geographic area. Certain of these smaller competitors may have lower
overhead cost structures and, consequently, may be able to charge
lower rates for their services. There are a number of large, integrated
national companies engaged in providing commercial services in the
service lines in which Expanets intends to focus, some of which also
manufacture and sell directly the products that Expanets services and
sells. Future competition may be encountered from other newly
formed or existing public or private service companies with aggressive
acquisition and marketing programs. Certain of Expanets' competitors
may have greater financial resources to finance acquisition and
internal growth opportunities and may be willing to pay higher prices
than Expanets for acquisition opportunities. Certain products and
20
North Western Corporation
services offered by Expanets are manufactured or supplied by others
and involve the risk of partial reliance upon third party systems and
services, as well as risks associated with the need to integrate
services and solutions across networks, platforms and equipment
manufactured or supplied by various companies.
YEAR 2000 READINESS
The year 2000 issue is a result of computer programs, which were
written using two digits (rather than the actual four) to identify the year
in the date field. This old approach was intended to save processing
time and storage space within computers and was continued in use
until the mid 1990s. If not corrected, affected systems and devices
containing computer chips or clocks may roll back to 1900 instead of
moving forward to 2000. Some systems and devices may continue to
function even if this occurs. Others may experience interruptions in
service, processes or obtain erroneous results.
The Corporation assembled a diverse oversight and advisory
team from all businesses with experienced information systems,
legal, communications and operating leadership to work on our
enterprise-wide year 2000 program. The initiative covered not
only the Corporation's information technology systems and
computer applications, but also considered hardware, embedded
systems and components internal and external to our organiza-
tions. The Corporation's program considered not only our
businesses and technology areas but also those of our customers
and suppliers. The Corporation spent approximately $2 million in
1999 related to the year 2000 issue which was expensed as
incurred or capitalized in accordance with our accounting policy
for software development costs.
As a result of year 2000 readiness efforts, the Corporation's
mission critical information technology systems did not experience
any material adverse application failures on January 1, 2000, and we
are not aware of any material adverse impacts to our suppliers or
customers. We do not believe that year 2000 issues have had any
material impact on customer spending patterns for our services and
solutions. The Corporation will continue to monitor its mission critical
computer applications throughout the year 2000 to ensure that any
potential year 2000 issues that may arise are addressed promptly.
The Corporation cannot provide assurance that our suppliers or
customers have not been affected by a year 2000 issue in a manner
that is not yet apparent.
Statements made in this Annual Report, including the letter to shareholders
and Management's Discussion and Analysis, such as those relating to expecta-
tion of future financial performance, continued growth, dividend policy, liquidity,
absence of year 2000 problems and the impact of changes in interest rates and
commodity prices, are forward-looking statements that involve inherent risks and
uncertainties. A number of important factors which are difficult to predict and
many of which are beyond the control of the Corporation, could cause actual
results to differ materially from those implied by the forward-looking statements.
These factors include, but are not limited to, the adverse impact of unseasonal
weather, developments in the federal and state regulatory environment, the rate
of growth in the service territories of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, the
speed and degree to which competition enters the Corporation's businesses, the
timing and extent of changes in interest rates, commodity prices and currency
exchange rates, risks associated with acquisitions and integration of acquired
companies, changes in customer usage patterns and preferences, changes in
technology, reliance on strategic partners, uncertainty of litigation, as well as
changing conditions in the economy, capital markets and other factors identified
from time to time in the Corporation's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. This Annual Report should be read in conjunction with the consoli-
dated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein.The management of NorthWestern is responsible for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information
contained in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements, which necessarily include some amounts which
are based on informed judgments and estimates of management, have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.
In meeting this responsibility, management maintains a system of internal accounting controls, which is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that the assets of the Corporation are safeguarded and that transactions are executed in
accordance with management's authorization and are recorded properly for the preparation of financial statements. This
system is supported by written policies, selection and training of qualified personnel, an appropriate segregation of
responsibilities within the organization, other internal accounting controls, and direct management monitoring and
review. The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, which is comprised entirely of outside directors, oversees
management's responsibilities for financial reporting. The Audit Committee meets regularly with management and the
independent public accountants to make inquiries as to the manner in which each is performing its responsibilities. The
independent public accountants have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, without management's presence, to
discuss auditing, internal accounting controls and financial reporting matters.
Arthur Andersen LLP, an independent public accounting firm, has been engaged annually to perform an audit of the
Corporation's financial statements. Their audit is conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards
and includes examining, on a test basis, supporting evidence, assessing the Corporation's accounting principles and
significant estimates made by management, reviewing financial controls and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation to the extent necessary to allow them to report on the fairness, in all material respects, of the operating
results and financial condition of the Corporation.

REPORT OF
INDEPENDENT
PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NORTHWESTERN CORPORATION (a Delaware
corporation) AND SUBSIDIARIES as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated statements of income,
cash flows and shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by manage-
ment, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
NorthWestern Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NorthWestern Corporation

CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
NorthWestern Corporation ("Corporation") is a service and
solutions company providing integrated energy, communications,
air conditioning, heating, ventilating, plumbing and related services
and solutions to residential and business customers throughout
North America. A division of the Corporation is engaged in the
regulated energy business of production, purchase, transmission,
distribution and sale of electricity and the delivery of natural gas to
Midwestern customers. Through CornerStone Propane Partners,
L.P. ("CornerStone"), the Corporation is engaged in the retail
propane and wholesale energy-related commodities distribution
business throughout North America. CornerStone is a publicly
traded Delaware master limited partnership, formed to acquire and
operate propane businesses and assets. A wholly owned
subsidiary of the Corporation serves as the general partner of
CornerStone and manages and operates ComerStone's business.
At December 31, 1999, the Corporation owns a combined
30% effective interest in ComerStone. Through Blue Dot Services
Inc. ("Blue Dot"), the Corporation is becoming a national provider
of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and related
services ("HVAC") through internal growth and by acquiring
existing companies throughout the U.S. Through Expanets, Inc.
("Expanets"), the Corporation is becoming a national provider of
integrated communications, data solutions and network services
to business customers through internal growth and by acquiring
companies throughout the U.S.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Corporation and all wholly and majority-
owned or controlled subsidiaries, including CornerStone,
Blue Dot and Expanets. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated from the consolidated
financial statements. The public unitholders' interest in
CornerStone's net assets subsequent to CornerStone's formation
is reflected as a minority interest in the consolidated financial
statements. Equity interests of the former owners of companies
acquired by Blue Dot and Expanets who continue to hold an
interest in Blue Dot and Expanets are reflected as minority inter-
ests in the consolidated financial statements. Losses allocable to
minority interests in the future may increase or decrease
depending upon the level of losses in these business segments,
the amount of preferred dividends and the remaining minority
interest basis available to absorb losses.
USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
CASH EQUIVALENTS
The Corporation generally considers all highly liquid invest-
26
NorthWestern Corporation
ments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
Accounts receivable is stated net of allowance for doubtful
accounts of $7.3 million and $6.1 million at December 31, 1999
and 1998, respectively.
INVESTMENTS AND FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Corporation's investments consist primarily of short-
maturity, fixed-income securities and corporate preferred and
common stocks. In addition, the Corporation has investments in
privately held entities and ventures, safe harbor leases and
various money market and tax exempt investment programs.
These investments are accounted for in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115
("SFAS 115"), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." SFAS 115 requires that certain investments in
debt and equity securities be reported at fair value.
The Corporation's available for sale securities are classified
under the provisions of SFAS 115 as follows:

27,376
Unrealized
Gain
$(3,180)
10,953
$ 1,987
2,669
The combined unrealized gain, net of tax, at December 31, 1999
and 1998, was $5.1 million and $2.2 million. Held to maturity
securities are reported at cost, which approximated fair value and at
December 31, 1999 and 1998, was $17.4 million and $80.9 million.
The Corporation uses the specific identification method for
determining the cost basis of its investments in available for sale
securities. Gross proceeds and realized gains and losses on
sales of its available for sale securities were not material in
1999, 1998 and 1997.
Based on current market rates for debt of similar credit
quality and remaining maturities or quoted market prices for
certain issues, the face value of the Corporation's long-term debt
approximates its market value.
CornerStone routinely uses commodity futures contracts to
reduce the risk of future price fluctuations for natural gas and
liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") inventories and contracts. Gains
and losses on futures contracts purchased as hedges are
deferred and recognized in cost of sales as a component of the
product cost for the related hedged transaction. Net realized
gains and losses on these contracts are generally not material.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Electric and natural gas revenues are based on billings
rendered to customers rather than on meters read or energy
delivered. Customers are billed monthly on a cycle basis.
Revenues from propane sales are recognized principally when
fuel products are shipped or delivered to customers. HVAC andcommunications revenues are recognized as goods are delivered
to customers or services are performed.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisi-
tion less depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the
various classes of property. Depreciable property has estimated
useful lives, which range from three to 40 years.
Depreciation rates include a provision for the Corporation's share
of the estimated costs to decommission three coal-fired generating
plants at the end of the useful life of each plant. The annual provision
for such costs is included in depreciation expense, while the accumu-
lated provisions are included in other noncurrent assets.
When property for the propane, HVAC or communications inter-
ests are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and related
accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts, and the
resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to operations. No profit
or loss is recognized in connection with ordinary retirements of
depreciable electric and natural gas property. Maintenance and
repairs are expensed as incurred, while replacements and better-
ments that extend estimated useful lives are capitalized. Property,
plant and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following:

$681,663

(196,588)
$629,278
COMPUTER SOFTWARE COSTS
The Corporation includes in property, plant and equipment
external and incremental internal costs associated with
computer software we develop for use in our businesses.
Capitalization begins when the costs of the preliminary stage of
the project is completed. These costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over an estimated useful life once the
installed software is ready for its intended use.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
The excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair
value of all tangible and intangible assets acquired, net of liabili-
ties assumed, has been recorded as goodwill. Other intangibles
consist principally of costs of covenants not to compete and
deferred financing costs. Intangibles and goodwill are being
amortized over the estimated periods benefited, which range
from three to 40 years. Financing costs are amortized over the
term of the applicable debt.
The Corporation's policy is to review property, goodwill and
other intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that
the carrying amount is not recoverable, the Corporation's policy
is to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to fair value.

INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes relate primarily to the difference
between book and tax methods of depreciating property, the
difference in the recognition of revenues for book and tax
purposes, and certain natural gas costs, which are deferred for
book purposes but expensed currently for tax purposes.
For book purposes, deferred investment tax credits are being
amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the useful
lives of the property which generated the credits.
REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The regulated operations of the Corporation are subject to
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 71 ("SFAS 71"), "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types
of Regulations." Regulatory assets represent probable future
revenue to the Corporation associated with certain costs, which
will be recovered from customers through the ratemaking
process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reduc-
tions in revenues associated with amounts that are to be
credited to customers through the ratemaking process.
If all or a separable portion of the Corporation's operations
becomes no longer subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, an
evaluation of future recovery-related regulatory assets and liabil-
ities would be necessary. In addition, the Corporation would
determine any impairment to the carrying costs of deregulated
plant and inventory assets.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities", establishes accounting and reporting
standards requiring that every derivative instrument (including
certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts) be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability
measured at its fair value. SFAS 133 requires changes in the
derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. SFAS 133, as
amended, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.
The Corporation is evaluating the impacts of adopting SFAS 133
on its financial statements. The impact of SFAS 133 will depend
upon the extent of use of derivative instruments and their desig.
nation and effectiveness as hedges of market risk.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain 1997 and 1998 amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 1999 presentation. Such reclassifications
had no impact on net income or shareholders' equity as
previously reported.

2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS
MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OFFERING AND ACQUISITIONS
On December 11, 1998, CornerStone acquired the opera-
tions of Propane Continental, Inc. (“PCI"), a retail propane and
wholesale energy-related commodities distributor for approxi-
mately $121 million, including assumed debt. The acquisition
was financed with Common Unit equity and long-term debt. The
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting, PC) operated 34 retail propane customer service
centers in 11 states. Through Tri Power Fuels, PCI's wholesale
business, PCI distributed propane and other natural gas liquids
to independent dealers, resellers and end users predominately
in the West, Midwest and Northeast sections of the country.
At December 31, 1999, CornerStone's capital consisted of
16,788,894 Common Units, 6,597,619 Subordinated Units
representing limited partner interests and a 2% aggregate
general partner interest. At December 31, 1999, the
Corporation's wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries owned
all 6,597,619 Subordinated Units and an aggregate 2%
general partner interest in CornerStone, or a combined 30%
effective interest.
1,551
BLUE DOT SERVICES INC.
In 1997, the Corporation formed Blue Dot to acquire and
operate HVAC companies in the U.S. At December 31, 1999,
Blue Dot had acquired 62 companies in 23 states with a total
investment by the Corporation of $155.4 million. At December 31,
1999, the Corporation owned a 96.9% voting interest in Blue Dot
through preferred and common stock ownership.
EXPANETS, INC.
In 1998, the Corporation formed Expanets to acquire and
operate communications companies in the U.S. At December 31,
1999, Expanets had acquired 26 companies in 32 states with a
total investment by the Corporation of $152.0 million. At
December 31, 1999, the Corporation owned a 95.8% voting
interest in Expanets through preferred and common stock
ownership.
During 1999, the Corporation formed a private equity invest-
ment limited liability company in which certain members of
management were provided the opportunity to make personal
investments. The limited liability company is controlled and
substantially owned by the Corporation and enables management
investors to participate in long-term value creation in selected
growth initiatives, including increases in the value of the
Corporation's interests in CornerStone, Blue Dot and Expanets.
The Corporation has the right to acquire the limited liability
company interests of the investors under specified circumstances.
The acquisitions made by Blue Dot and Expanets were
effected utilizing a combination of cash and stock (of Blue Dot or
Expanets) and generally with a combination of both. In connec-
tion with certain acquisitions, both Blue Dot and Expanets
entered into exchange agreements with the sellers that typically
do not exceed two years. Under such agreements, the seller can
elect to exchange the stock of Blue Dot or Expanets that they
received in connection with the acquisition back to the
Corporation for, at the Corporation's option, either stock of the
Corporation or cash at a predetermined exchange rate.
The acquisitions made by CornerStone, Blue Dot and
Expanets have been accounted for using the purchase method'
of accounting and, accordingly, the assets acquired and liabili-
ties assumed have been recorded at their fair values as of the
dates of acquisitions. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has
been recorded as goodwill. The assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the current year acquisitions have been recorded
based upon preliminary estimates of fair value as of the dates of
acquisition. The Corporation does not believe the final allocation
of purchase price will be materially different from preliminary
allocations. Any changes to the preliminary estimates will be
reflected as an adjustment to goodwill. At December 31, 1999,
liabilities for approximately $12.7 million for costs associated
with the shutdown and consolidation of certain acquired facili-
ties and $3.8 million in severance costs are recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 1998, liabilities
for approximately $19.7 million for costs associated with the
shutdown and consolidation of certain acquired facilities and
$12.5 million in severance costs are recorded on the consoli-
dated balance sheet. Results of operations for these acquisi-
tions have been included in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements since the dates of acquisition. The accom-
panying unaudited consolidated pro forma results of operations
for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999 give effect to
the acquisitions as if such transactions had occurred at the
beginning of the period:

The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information
does not purport to represent what the Corporation's financial
position or results of operations would actually have been if
these transactions had occurred at such dates or to project the
Corporation's future results of operations.
3. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
The Corporation may issue short-term debt in the form of
bank loans and commercial paper as interim financing for
general corporate purposes. The bank loans may be obtained
under short-term lines of credit. At December 31, 1999, the
Corporation's aggregate lines of credit available were $24.5 million.
The Corporation pays an annual fee generally equivalent to.1% to .25% of the unused lines. At December 31, 1999, there
were $11.0 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.
No line of credit borrowings or commercial paper was outstand-
ing at December 31, 1998.
Expanets entered into a Bank Credit Facility in June 1998 with
a commercial bank, Expanets' Bank Credit Facility consists of a
$15 million Working Capital Facility. There were $14.7 million and
$8.5 million of borrowings outstanding under Expanets' Facility at
December 31, 1999 and 1998. Expanets' Credit Facility bears
interest at a variable rate tied to the Eurodollar or prime rate plus a
stated margin for each rate. Expanets' Credit Facility matured on
December 31, 1999. Expanets has received an extension on this
facility while it negotiates an increase and certain other changes to
the Facility. The Facility is not secured, however, Expanets is subject
to restrictive covenants which include a) restrictions on other
indebtedness, b) limits on mergers, acquisitions and dispositions,
and c) minimum investment in Expanets by the Corporation. The
Expanets' Facility is nonrecourse to the Corporation.
4. LONG-TERM DEBT
Substantially all of the Corporation's electric and natural
gas utility plant is subject to the lien of the indentures securing
its general mortgage bonds and pollution control obligations.
General mortgage bonds of the Corporation may be issued in
amounts limited by property, earnings and other provisions
of the mortgage indenture. As part of a financing transaction in
November 1998, the Corporation issued $105 million of
6.95%, 30-year senior unsecured debt. The proceeds were used
to repay short-term indebtedness and for general corporate
purposes. The Corporation entered into an unsecured Bank
Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks in June 1999.
The Bank Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes
including acquisitions. There were $58 million of borrowings
outstanding and $112 million available under the Bank Credit
Facility at December 31, 1999. The Bank Credit Facility bears
interest at a variable rate tied to certain Eurodollar index or
prime rate plus a variable margin, which depends upon the total
borrowings outstanding on the facility. The Bank Credit Facility
matures in June 2002. The Bank Credit Facility contains restric-
tive covenants, which require the Corporation to maintain a
minimum net worth and a maximum debt to equity ratio. The
following table summarizes the Corporation's long-term obliga-
tions at December 31:

NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The CornerStone First Mortgage Notes ("Mortgage Notes")
are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of
CornerStone and rank pari passu with the Bank Credit Facility.
The Mortgage Notes mature in the year 2010 with eight equal
annual installments beginning in the year 2003. CornerStone
may, at its option and under certain circumstances following
the disposition of assets, be required to offer to prepay the
Mortgage Notes in whole or in part. The Mortgage Notes
agreement contains restrictive covenants applicable to
CornerStone including a) restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, b) restrictions on the ratio of consol-
idated cash flow to consolidated interest expense of
CornerStone, as defined, and c) restrictions on certain liens,
loans and investments, payments, mergers, consolidations,
sales of assets and other transactions. Generally, as long as
no default exists or would result, CornerStone is permitted to
make cash distributions not more frequently than quarterly in
an amount not to exceed available cash, as defined, for the
immediately preceding calendar quarter.
CornerStone also has a Bank Credit Facility with a group
of commercial banks. The Bank Credit Facility consists of a
combined $110 million Working Capital and Acquisition
Facilities to finance propane business acquisitions. There
were $9.2 million and $1.7 million of combined borrowings
outstanding under the Working Capital and Acquisition
Facilities at December 31, 1999 and 1998. Total available
under the Bank Credit Facility is $81.8 million as an
additional $19.0 million is required to be held as collateral
for the Bank Credit Facility borrowings. The Bank Credit
Facility bears interest at a variable rate tied to a certain
Eurodollar index or prime rate plus a variable margin for
either rate, which depends upon the Partnership's ratio of
consolidated debt to consolidated cash flow. The Bank
Credit Facility matures in November 2001. The Bank Credit
Facility is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the
Partnership and ranks pari passu with the Mortgage Notes.
The Bank Credit Facility contains restrictive covenants
similar to those under the Mortgage Notes and also requires
that CornerStone maintain a ratio of total funded indebted.
ness to consolidated cash flow, as defined. Generally, as
long as no default exists or would result, CornerStone is
permitted to make cash quarterly distributions in an amount
not to exceed Available Cash, as defined.
Blue Dot entered into a Bank Credit Facility with a group
of commercial banks in February 1999 providing for
advances up to $135.0 million. The Bank Credit Facility is
used for working capital and to finance business acquisi-
tions. There were $28.2 million of borrowings outstanding
and $106.8 million available under the Bank Credit Facility at
December 31, 1999. The Bank Credit Facility bears interest
at a variable rate tied to certain Eurodollar rates or prime
rate plus a variable margin, which depends upon Blue Dot's

6. TEAM MEMBER BENEFIT PLANS
The Corporation maintains a noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan for team members of corporate and the
regulated utility division. The benefits to which a team
member is entitled under the plan are derived using a formula
based on the number of years of service and compensation
levels, as defined. The Corporation determines the annual
funding for its plan using the frozen initial liability cost
method. The Corporation's annual contribution is funded in
accordance with the requirements of ERISA. Assets of the plan
consist primarily of debt and equity securities.

During 1999, the Corporation made available to eligible
team members the option to convert their pension plan benefit
to a cash balance plan. All elections were made prior to
December 31, 1999, and are effective January 1, 2000. Eligible
new team members hired after December 31, 1999, will
automatically be enrolled in the cash balance plan as there will be
no new participants in the pension plan after December 31, 1999.
The result of team members choosing the cash balance plan will
not materially impact the Corporation's 2000 financial state-
ments. The pension plan will continue for those eligible team
members who did not elect the cash balance plan.
The Corporation also provides an Employee Stock Ownership
Plan ("ESOP") for full-time team members of corporate and the
regulated utility division. The ESOP is funded primarily with
federal income tax savings, which arise from tax laws applicable
to such team member benefit plans. Certain Corporation contri-
butions and shares of stock acquired by the ESOP are allocated
to participants' accounts in proportion to the compensation of
team members during the particular year for which allocation is
made. Costs incurred under the plan were $1.0 million, $1.0 million
and $.9 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997.
The Corporation also has various supplemental retirement plans
for outside directors and selected management team members.
The plans are nonqualified defined benefit plans that provide for
certain amounts of salary continuation in the event of death before
or after retirement or certain supplemental retirement benefits in
lieu of any death benefits. In addition, the Corporation provides life
insurance benefits to beneficiaries of eligible team members who
represent a reasonable insurable risk. To minimize the overall cost
of plans providing life insurance benefits, the Corporation has
obtained life insurance coverage that is sufficient to fund benefit
obligations: Costs incurred under the plans were $1.3 million,
$1.5 million and $1.2 million in 1999, 1998 and 1997.
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CornerStone has a Restricted Unit Plan ("Restricted Unit
Plan"), which authorizes the issuance of Common Units with an
aggregate value of $17.5 million to directors, executives,
managers and selected supervisors of the Partnership. The
value of the Restricted Common Unit is established by the
market price of the Common Unit at the date of grant. As of
December 31, 1999, Restricted Common Units with a face value
of $16.1 million have been awarded.
The Corporation, CornerStone, Blue Dot and Expanets provide
various team member savings plans, which permit team members
to defer receipt of compensation as provided in Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Under the plans, the team member may
elect to direct a percentage of their gross compensation to be
contributed to the plans. The Corporation contributes 50 cents for
every one dollar contributed by the team member, up to a
maximum Corporation contribution of 3% of the team member's
gross compensation. ComerStone, Blue Dot and Expanets match a
portion of the team member contributions. Costs incurred under all
of these plans were $3.0 million, $1.5 million and $.7 million in
1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
7. JOINTLY OWNED PLANTS
The Corporation has an ownership interest in three electric
generating plants, all of which are coal fueled and operated by
other utility companies. The Corporation has an undivided
interest in these facilities and is responsible for its proportionate
share of the capital and operating costs while being entitled to its
proportionate share of the power generated. The Corporation's
interest in each plant is reflected in the Consolidated Balance
Sheets on a pro rata basis, and its share of operating expenses is
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The partici-
pants each finance their own investment.
Information relating to the Corporation's ownership interest
in these facilities at December 31, 1999, is as follows:

Stock Option and Incentive Plan ("Plan"). Under the Plan, the

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Corporation has reserved 2,750,000 shares for issuance to
officers, key team members and directors as either incentive-
based options or nonqualified options. The Nominating and
Compensation Committee of the Corporation's Board of Directors
administers the Plan. Unless established differently by the
Committee, the per share option exercise price shall be the fair
market value of the Corporation's common stock at the grant
date. The options are outstanding for 10 years following the date
of grant. In addition, the Corporation issued 1,279,476 warrants

The Corporation follows Accounting Principles Board
Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," to
account for stock option plans. No compensation cost is recog-
nized because the option exercise price is equal to the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
An alternative method of accounting for stock options is
SFAS 123,"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." Under
SFAS 123, team member stock options are valued at grant date
using the Black-Scholes valuation model and compensation cost is
recognized ratably over the vesting period. Had compensation cost
for the Corporation's stock option plan been determined based on
the Black-Scholes value at the grant dates for awards as prescribed
by SFAS 123, the pro forma information for 1999 and 1998 would
have been as follows:

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus
the effect of the outstanding stock options and warrants. The

11. CORNERSTONE DISTRIBUTIONS
CornerStone makes distributions to its partners with respect
to each fiscal quarter of the Partnership in an aggregate amount
equal to its Available Cash, as defined in its partnership agree-
ment. Distributions will generally be made 98% to the Common
and Subordinated Unitholders and 2% to the general partner. To
the extent there is sufficient Available Cash, the holders of
Common Units have the right to receive the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution, plus any arrearages, prior to the distribution of
Available Cash to holders of Subordinated Units. Common Units
will not accrue arrearages for any quarter after the
Subordination Period (as defined below), and Subordinated
Units will not accrue any arrearages with respect to distributions
for any quarter.
The Subordination Period will generally extend until the first
day of any quarter beginning on or after December 31, 2001, in
respect of which a) distributions of Available Cash from
operating surplus equal or exceed the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution on each of the outstanding Common and
Subordinated Units for each of the three consecutive four-
quarter periods immediately preceding such date, b) the
adjusted operating surplus generated during each of the three
consecutive four-quarter periods immediately preceding such
date equals or exceeds the Minimum Quarterly Distribution on
each of the Common and Subordinated Units and the related
distribution on the general partner interests in the Partnership
during such periods, and c) there are no outstanding Common
Unit arrearages.
In addition, 1,649,405 Subordinated Units may convert into
Common Units for any quarter ending on or after December 31,
1999, and an additional 1,649,405 Subordinated Units may
convert into Common Units for any quarter ending on or after
December 31, 2000, if a) distributions of Available Cash from,operating surplus on each of the outstanding Common and
Subordinated Units equal or exceed the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution for each of the three consecutive four-quarter
periods immediately preceding such date, b) the adjusted
operating surplus generated during the immediately preceding
two consecutive four-quarter periods equals or exceeds the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution on all of the Common and
Subordinated Units outstanding during that period and c) there
are no arrearages on the Common Units.
The Partnership will make distributions of its Available Cash
approximately 45 days after the end of each quarter ending
March, June, September and December to holders of record on
the applicable record dates. For all quarters ended after
December 31, 1997, CornerStone and the Corporation have
elected to forgo the Subordinated Unit distributions, continuing
the support for the Common Unitholders.
12. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
The Corporation is subject to numerous state and federal
environmental regulations. The Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990 (the Act) stipulate limitations on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Corporation
believes it can economically meet such sulfur dioxide emission
requirements at its generating plants and that it is in compliance
with all presently applicable environmental protection require-
ments and regulations. The Corporation is also subject to other
environmental statues and regulations including matters related
to former manufactured gas plant sites. No administrative or
judicial proceedings involving the Corporation are now pending or
known by the Corporation to be contemplated under present
environmental protection requirements.
13. CAPITAL STOCK
In December 1996, the Corporation's Board of Directors
declared, pursuant to a shareholders' rights plan, a dividend
distribution of one Right on each outstanding share of the
Corporation's common stock. Each Right becomes exercisable,
upon the occurrence of certain events, at an exercise price of
$50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Rights are currently
not exercisable and will be exercisable only if a person or group
of affiliated or associated persons ("Acquiring Person") either
acquires ownership of 15% or more of the Corporation's common
stock or commences a tender or exchange offer that would
result in ownership of 15% or more. In the event the Corporation
is acquired in a merger or other business combination transac-
tion or 50% or more of its consolidated assets or earnings power
are sold, each Right entitles the holder to receive such number of
shares of common stock of the Acquiring Person having a market
value of two times the then current exercise price of the Right.
The Rights, which expire in December 2006, are redeemable in
whole, but not in part, at a price of $.005 per Right, at the
Corporation's option at any time until any Acquiring Person has
acquired 15% or more of the Corporation's common stock.
The Corporation is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of
$100 par cumulative preferred stock. As of December 31, 1999
and 1998, there were 37,500 shares outstanding of which
26,000 were 4 1/2 % Series and 11,500 were 6 1/2% Series.
NOTES TO
CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The provisions of the 6 1/2% Series stock contain a five-year put
option exercisable by the holders of the securities and a 10-year
redemption option exercisable by the Corporation. In any event,
redemption will occur at par value. The 4 1/2% Series may be
redeemed in whole or in part at the option of the Board of
Directors at any time upon at least 30 days notice at $110.00 per
share plus accrued dividends.
In the event of involuntary dissolution, all Corporation
preferred stock outstanding would have a preferential interest
of $100 per share, plus accumulated dividends, before any
distribution to common shareholders.
The Corporation is authorized to issue a maximum of
1,000,000 shares of preference stock at a par value of $50 per
share. No preference shares have ever been issued.
As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Corporation had
3,500,000 shares of preferred securities outstanding.
1,300,000 shares outstanding were issued in 1995 at 8 1/8%
with a $25 par value. An additional 2,200,000 shares were
issued as part of a financing transaction in November 1998
when the Corporation sold $55,000,000 of its 7.2% preferred
capital securities at $25 par value. The proceeds were used for
general corporate purposes.
14. SEGMENT AND RELATED INFORMATION
In 1998, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 131 ("SFAS 131"), “Disclosures
About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information,"
which requires the reporting of certain financial information by
business segment. For the purpose of providing segment infor-
mation, the Corporation's six principal business segments are
its electric, natural gas, retail propane, wholesale propane,
HVAC and communications operations. The "All Other" segment
includes the results of service and other nonenergy-related
operations, manufacturing operations (1998 only), activities
and assets of the corporate office, as well as any reconciling or
eliminating amounts.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the
same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies except that the parent allocates some of its
operating expenses and interest expense to the operating
segments according to a methodology designed by manage-
ment for internal reporting purposes and involves estimates
and assumptions. Financial data for the business segments are
as follows:
