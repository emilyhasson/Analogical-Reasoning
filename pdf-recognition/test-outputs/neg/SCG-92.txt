SCANA Corporation,
headquartered in Columbia,
SC, is a $3 billion energy-
based holding company with 11
direct wholly-owned subsidiaries
engaged in electric and natural gas
utility operations and related businesses.
SCANA's principal subsidiary, South Carolina
Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), is a regulated public
utility serving approximately 462,000 electric customers
in a 15,000 square-mile territory in the central, southern
and southwestem portions of South Carolina.
Through the combined operations of SCE&G
and South Carolina Pipeline Corporation, SCANA's gas
transmission subsidiary, natural gas services are
provided throughout the state on a direct or
supplemental basis. The lotal population of SCANA's
utility service areas is approximately three million.
SCE&G also provides transit services in the metropolitan
areas of Columbia and Charleston. Other regulated
utility subsidiaries own an electric generating plant near
Charleston and provide financing for SCE&G's coal and
nuclear fuel inventories.
SCANA's nonregulated diversified operations
extend beyond South Carolina and include oil and
natural gas production, purchase, delivery and sale of
propane, marketing of natural gas and other light
hydrocarbons, fiber-optic based lelecommunications,
real estate development and property management, and
power plant management services. At year-end 1992,
SCANA and its subsidiaries had 4,849 employees.

SCE&G fleets already use natural gas
to power various types of vehicles.
It is nearly impossible to differentiate
between the operation of natural gas and
gasoline. In fact the same vehicle can
carry both fuels. The National Energy Policy
Act of 1992 mandated the use of
alternatively fueled vehicles in fleets for
federal and state government, as well as
alternative fuel providers such as SCE&G,
beginning in the mid-1990s.

ABOUT THE COVER
The site of the new 385-MW Cope Electric Generating
Station is located on a plateau of flat farmland encircled by low-
lying wetlands. As part of our heightened environmental
sensitivity, construction for the plant will only impact one-half
acre of the wetlands on the 3000-acre tract. In addition, the
closed-cycle plant will use less water from the river than
traditional plants because water circulates through the plant, is
cooled and then used again. The plant will blend with the
environment, being painted in neutral earthtones, and will be
surrounded by a buffer zone of vegetation.2
So
SCANA devotes a considerable
portion of its philanthropic resources to
educatio Here SCANA Chairman of the
Board, President and Chief Executive
Officer Lawrence M. Gressette, Jr.
enjoys a book with a group of
kindergarten students. In addition to
sponsoring programs which support
primary, middle and high schools in the
state, SCANA's commitment extends to
many colleges and universities.
CHAIRMAN'S LETTER
Fellow Stockholders:
1992 was a poor year financially for SCANA
Corporation. We did, however, make important progress
in many areas that will discuss later in this letter.
Earnings declined 16% to $2.84 per common
share for several reasons. First, the Supreme Court of
South Carolina ruled that there was not sufficient evi-
dence for the Public Service Commission of South
Carolina to have established retail electric rates on the
basis of a 13.25% cost of equity in our 1989 retail
electric rate case. The Court did find sufficient evidence
to support a 13.0% return on equity. The resulting
refund covering three years reduced earnings $.27 per
share, and is nonrecurring. Second, very temperate
weather and continuing effects of the recession resulted
in flat sales volume and margins in our regulated busi-
nesses, despite customer growth at near historic levels.
Third, fixed and variable operating expenses increased
4%, but were well within budgeted expectations. While
the financial results are not pleasing, the fundamental
operating performance was quite good.
The recent slowdown of the economy in the
beginning of this decade shows signs of ending, and
I believe we will see a new period of growth for the elec-
tric operations of the company. Our customer growth
has continued despite the poor economy of the past
year, and we see no reason for this to change. Our
industrial growth recently has shown signs of returning
to former levels. With the addition of the Cope Electric
Generating Station, now under construction, we will be
positioned to meet our customers' future electric energy
needs and to assure ample energy for continued eco-
nomic development in our service area. In December wefiled with the Public Service Commission for an increase
in electric rates, and expect an order from the Com-
mission in June 1993. This ruling seeks to increase
rates approximately 11.4% in two phases. If the entire
increase is allowed, electric rates will remain at approxi-
mately 1984 levels. An increase in revenues will allow
us to pay for construction costs associated with the
Cope generating plant and to offset increased taxes,
depreciation and operating expenses.
The cash dividend will be increased effective
April 1, 1993 to $2.74 per common share. While the
increase is not as great as I would like, it does reflect
the positive growth in customers in the past year, the
current capital needs for construction and the disap-
pointing financial results in 1992. This increase is the
18th year in a row that the dividend has increased, and
the 40th time in the last 41 years.
In late 1992, the National Energy Policy Act
was signed into law by President Bush. This Act essen-
tially provides for restructuring of the electric industry in
this country. Several years ago we began to reorganize
and structure our electric operations to adapt to the new
competitive and regulatory realities, and they are out-
lined on page 6. I am confident that we are moving
decisively and quickly to address the challenges and
capture the opportunities presented by this new law.
The natural gas business has experienced
significant change in the past 10 years in response to
the partial deregulation of that industry. In 1992 the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued Order
636, intended to be the final step in this process. Our
natural gas operations have done an excellent job in
profiting from the opportunities presented by this restruc-
turing, while minimizing losses from the less positive
aspects of the change. In the past few years, we have
expanded our natural gas operations to encompass the
exploration, production and direct marketing segments of
the industry. We now own 151 billion cubic feet equivo-
lent (Bcfe) of proved natural gas reserves, at a total
investment of $124.8 million. Last year we sold 17.7 Bcf
of gas outside our traditional markets in South Carolina,
and expect to increase those sales by 50% In 1993.
We continue to evaluate each of our business
segments and to narrow our focus to energy related
activities. As a result, in 1992 we ceased operations in
the construction division of Prímesouth, but we will con-
tinue to operate and maintain power plants for indepen-
dent power producers in other states.
Our employees continue to perform at extremely
high levels despite the uncertainties caused by corporate
restructuring. They won numerous awards for the out-
standing performance of the nuclear plant, extended ser-
vice in the restoration after Hurricane Andrew in Florida,
community involvement and other industry recognition.
Our employees, active and retired, continue to own 12%
of the outstanding stock of the company. They are the
foundation of our future success, and I look forward to
working with them to continue our progress in the future.

SOUTH CAROLINA
ELECTRIC & GAS COMPANY
PANY
COPE PA OJECT
• We began work in November on our first
major electric construction project since 1984. The 385-
megawatt generating station near Cope, South Carolina
will be the sixth coal-fired, baseload plant on our sys-
tem and will satisfy customers' increasing demand for
electric power. All major permits needed to date have
been secured, and the project is within budget and on
schedule. Construction is expected to be completed by
the spring of 1996. The cost of the plant is approximate-
ly $450 million, most of which is covered by a fixed-
price contract.
. We continued to demonstrate our commitment
to good environmental stewardship by using design
criteria that will make the Cope facility one of the most
benign coal-fired plants in the nation. The Cope plant
site was selected following the most comprehensive
environmental impact study in our history. Less tho
one-half acre of nearly 1700 acres of wetlands on
the project grounds will be impacted by the con-
struction and operations of the plant. The facility
will employ a closed-cycle cooling system that
will result in minimal water withdrawal from a
nearby river used for fishing and other recre-
ational purposes. About $70 million of the
investment will be for emission and
pollution control equipment that will
allow the plant to meet the require-
ments of the Clean Air Act
Amendments
of 1990.
NUCLEAR AND FOSSIL
PLANT OPERATIONS
• The nuclear operations group
posted another outstanding year in
1992. Twice the V.C. Summer
Nuclear Station was recognized as
one of the top nuclear plants in
the country by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC).
The top performer designation is one of the
industry's highest honors and is based on a semiannual
review that identifies those plants demonstrating a level
of safety deserving of formal NRC recognition. In addi-
tion, Summer Station received another top Category 1
rating from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations
(INPO), an industry oversight group which promotes
overall excellence in the nuclear utility industry. Only
about 20 of the 71 nuclear facilities in the United States
evaluated by INPO carry this rating. Summer Station
has received INPO's highest rating in three of its last
four evaluations.
• Summer Station also recorded impressive
operational results in 1992. For the 12 months ended
December 31, the unit availability factor was 97.1%
while the capacity factor was 96.7%. A 65-day refuel-
ing and maintenance outage - the plants seventh -
is scheduled to begin in March.
• The record of our fossil plants was also out-
standing. We recorded the highest availability factor in
our history, 88.1%, with a forced outage rate of 1.8%.
Both of these measures are considerably better than
national averages....one of the top nuclear plants in the country...
HURRICANE ANDREW RELIEF
Repaying a favor from three years earlier, we
sent line crews to South Florida to help in the recovery
from Hurricane Andrew. We rotated four 55-member line
crews along with transmission crews and support per
sonnel while helping to restore power to customers of
Florida Power & Light. FP&L was one of dozens of utili-
ties that came to our aid in the aftermath of Hurricane
Hugo in 1989.
●
REGULATORY ACTIVITIES
• In December we filed an application with the
Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSC) for
the first general increase in retail electric base rates in
nearly four years. The filing proposes a two-phase
increase. The phase one request is for 8.9% in addi-
tional revenues, or $72.9 million annually, expected to
take effect in June 1993. In phase two, we requested an
additional 2.5% increase in revenues or $20.2 million
annually, which would take effect in June 1994. The
PSC is expected to issue an order by June 1993. If the
full amount is granted by the PSC, our residential
customers will be paying in 1994 approximately
the same price for electricity as they did in 1984.
Pa
In September the PSC approved continued
operation of a Weather Normalization Adjustment
(WNA) for retail natural gas customers for one year.
The implementation of the WNA provided significant
stability to our retail natural gas operations during the
past year's mild winter.
SOUTH CAROLINA
PIPELINE CORPORATION
• Our intrastate natural gas pipeline subsidiary
began construction in March on a $24 million liquefied
natural gas satellite facility. The new facility will increase
peak day deliverabil ty and reliability, provide additional
storage capacity and reduce the cost of gas supplies.
The facility will store up to 900,000 Mof of liquefied
natural gas that can be converted back to a gaseous
state and used at times of peak winter demand. The
new plant is being built on a centrally located 200-acre
site which will allow us to supplement all of our trans-
mission lines that supply gas to major metropolitan
markets. The new facility is
expected to be operational in
early 1994.
bedzSCANA PETROLEUM
RESOURCES, INC.
. Two significant acquisitions highlighted our
oil and natural gas development and production activi-
fies during 1992. In September we purchased a produc-
ing field in Mississippi with 51.6 billion cubic feet
equivalent (Bcfe) of proven natural gas reserves. Earlier
in the year, we purchased offshore properties in the Gulf
of Mexico with 44.5 Bcfe of proven reserves. Since
1990 we have made eight acquisitions and now own
approximately 151 Bcfe of reserves. These acquisitions
bring our total investment to $124.8 million. We expect
to make additional acquisitions and to develop addition-
al reserves in these properties. Despite widely fluctuating
gas prices, these operations were profitable during 1992.
MPX SYSTEMS, INC.
. During 1992 we completed a 130-mile fiber
optic line from Atlanta to Columbus, Georgia. Another
30-mile line under construction in Alabama should be
completed in early 1993. With these additions, we will
have approximately 625 miles of fiber optic lines in
operation in three Southeastern states. In addition, we
unveiled a new wide area Specialized Mobile Radio
Network for the State of South Carolina that is the first of
its kind in the nation. This system enables law enforce-
ment, public safety and other users of two-way radio
communications to talk directly on one channel instead
of individual frequencies that must be patched together.
We will build and manage the network utilizing our exist-
ing fiber optic and microwave communications systems.
COMING CHALLENGES
NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY
• Deregulation is the most significant issue
facing the electric utility industry. The National Energy
Policy Act passed by Congress in 1992 created new and
pervasive competition in the generation of electricity.
Additionally, it removed many of the traditional barriers
to competition for the sale of electricity to wholesale
customers, commonly referred to as wholesale access.
• While wholesale access is significant, we
believe it is only a prelude to customer choice at the
retail level, a fundamental change that will reshape the
electric utility industry. In passing the National Energy
Policy Act, Congress left the question of retail access in
the hands of state regulators. Debate is underway in a
number of states. The question is not if, but when, retail
access arrives.
• We realize that to prosper in an era of cus-
tomer choice, we must be competitive in the price of our
product and in the quality of service
we provide. We are positioning our-
selves to capitalize on this compe-
tition with aggressive changes of
our own.
• We have reorga-
nized our company into
Strategic Business Units
(SBUS) to improve our
accountability and
flexibility. SBUS
will align our
businesses with
those specialized
industry segments
THISZOR

ina...wholesale access is only a prelude to customer choice...
created by deregulation and allow us to measure
accountability on a business-by-business basis. In
addition, the competitiveness of in-house service orga-
nizations that support the SBUS will be evaluated
against outside service providers. We have eliminated
nonessential levels of management by reviewing our
organizational structures. And, we have embraced a
customer-focused continuous improvement philosophy
that constantly drives us to be cost-effective, efficient
and quick to respond to customer needs.
NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY
RESTRUCTURING
. On April 8, 1992 the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Order 636,
which significantly changed the structure of interstate
natural gas pipeline service. These changes will have a
substantial effect on our natural gas operations. The
traditional interstate pipeline sales service is a bundled
service that includes gas supply, firm transportation and
underground storage at a single rolled-in price. Order
636 requires the unbundling and separate pricing of
these services by all interstate pipelines Unbundling will
allow us the opportunity to purchase the level of each
service needed to best serve our customers' requirements.
• Order 636 also requires pipelines to provide
transportation service that is equal in quality for all gas
suppliers whether the customer purchases the gas from
the pipeline or another supplier That equal access,
along with unbundling, is designed to complete the
transition to a competitive natural gas industry. During
1992 we saw wide gas price variations resulting in part
from the industry's dealing with unregulated gas mar-
kets. Prices should stabilize as the natural gas industry
gains experience in the fully competitive world.
• This latest change, and the ones which
preceded it, have created new opportunities for us. By
forming our own marketing company to sell natural gas
directly to end-users, we are unbundling our pipeline
Transmission and supply businesses. This company is
now selling substant al volumes of natural gas in South
Carolina and equal cmounts outside the state. Because
of our long history of directly negotiating sales contracts
with industrial customers and others, we believe our
natural gas businesses will be able to operate success-
'ully and profitably in this new environment.
FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS
• For the next few years, capital expenditures
associated with new electric generation, the continued
growth of our retail customer base, the resolve to com-
ply with environmental requirements and the acquisition
of natural gas reserves will require capital investment
which, in total, will exceed funds generated from opera-
tions In anticipation of the need for significant external
financing, we strengthened our position by substantial
additions to commor equity in 1992. The timing and
nature of the externa financing will depend on the
condition of the finar cial markets, the pace of capital
spending and the results of operations.

Common EquityMANAGEMENT REPORT
The management of SCANA Corporation
(Company) is responsible for the preparation and
Integrity of the financial data included in the accompa-
nying Consolidated Financial Statements. These state-
ments have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles, as applicable. In situa-
tions that prevent exact accounting measurements,
management has used informed judgments and esti-
mates. Financial information presented elsewhere in
this Annual Report is consistent with these financial
statements.
The Company maintains and relies upon a
system of internal accounting controls designed to pro-
vide reasonable assurance that all transactions are
properly recorded in the books and records and that
assets are protected against loss or unauthorized use.
The degree of internal accounting control is based upon
the determination of the optimum balance between the
cost incurred in maintaining a system of internal con-
trols and the benefits to be derived. The system of inter-
nal accounting controls is supported by written policies
and guidelines and is complemented by the selection,
training and development of professional financial
managers and by a staff of internal auditors who con-
duct comprehensive internal audits.
The Board of Directors provides oversight for
the preparation of the financial statements through its
Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of non-
employee directors. The Audit Committee meets periodi-
cally with management and internal auditors to review
their activities and responsibilities. The Audit Committee
also meets periodically with the Company's indepen-
dent auditors, Deloitte & Touche. The internal and inde-
pendent auditors have free access to the Audit
Committee to discuss internal accounting controls,
auditing and financial reporting matters.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS'
REPORT
SCANA CORPORATION:
We have audited the Consolidated Balance
Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Capitalization of
SCANA Corporation and subsidiaries (Company) as of
December 31, 1992 and 1991 and the related
Consolidated Statements of Income and Retained
Earnings and of Cash Flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1992. These finan-
cial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsiblilty is to express an opin-
ion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards. Those stan-
dards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the finan-
cial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the over-
all financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements pre-
sent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of the Company at December 31, 1992 and 1991, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the perlod ended December 31,
1992 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
A. Organization and Principles of Consolidation
D. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
Allowance for funds used during construction (AFC), a noncash
item, reflects the period cost of capital devoted to plant under con-
struction. This accounting practice results in the inclusion, as a
component of construction cost (construction work in progress), of
the costs of debt and equity capital dedicated to construction invest-
ment. AFC will ultimately be Included in rate base investment and
depreciated as a component of plant cost in establishing rates for
utility services. The Company's regulated subsidiaries calculated
AFC using composite rates of 9.6%, 9.7% and 9.5% for 1992,
1991 and 1990, respectively. These rates do not exceed the maxi-
mum allowable rate as calculated under FERC Order No. 561.
Interest on nuclear fuel in process is capitalized at the actual interest
amount.
SCANA Corporation (Company), a South Carolina corporation,
is a public utility holding company within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, but is exempt from registration
under such Act.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect
the consolidation of the accounts of the Company and its wholly
owned subsidiaries:
Regulated utilities
South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G)
South Carolina Fuel Company, Inc.
South Carolina Generating Company, Inc. (GENCO)
South Carolina Pipeline Corporation (Pipeline Corporation)
Nonregulated businesses
MPX Systems, Inc.
Primesouth, Inc.
SCANA Capital Resources, Inc.
SCANA Hydrocarbons, Inc.
SCANA Petroleum Resources, Inc.
South Carolina Real Estate Development Company, Inc.
Suburban Propane Group, Inc.
Investments in joint ventures in real estate are reported using
the equity method of accounting. Significant intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
B. System of Accounts
The accounting records of the Company's regulated sub-
sidiaries are maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of
Accounts prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) and as adopted by the Public Service Commission of South
Carolina (PSC).
C. Utility Plant
Utility plant is stated substantially at original cost. The costs of
additions, renewals and betterments to utility plant, Including direct
labor, material and indirect charges for engineering, supervision and
an allowance for funds used during construction, are added to utility
plant accounts. The original cost of utility property retired or otherwise
disposed of is removed from utility plant accounts and generally
charged, along with the cost of removal, less salvage, to accumulat-
ed depreciation. The costs of repairs, replacements and renewals of
Items of property determined to be less than a unit of property are
charged to maintenance expense.
SCE&G, operator of the V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (Summer
Station), and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (PSA), a
body corporate and politic of the State of South Carolina, are joint
owners of Summer Station in the proportions of two-thirds and one-
third, respectively. The parties share the operating costs and energy
output of the plant in these proportions. Each party, however, pro-
vides its own financing. Plant in service related to SCE&G's portion
of Summer Station was approximately $916.0 million at December
31, 1992 and 1991. Accumulated depreciation associated with
SCE&G's share of Summer Station was approximately $262.2 mil-
lion and $247.6 million as of December 31, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. SCE&G's share of the direct expenses associated with
operating Summer Station is included in the Company's "Other
E. Deferred Return on Plant Investment
Commencing July 1, 1987, as approved by a PSC order on
that date, SCE&G ceased the deferral of carrying costs associated
with 400 MW of electric generating capacity previously removed
from rate base and began amortizing the accumulated deferred car-
rying costs on a straight-line basis over a ten-year period (see Note
21). Amortization of deferred carrying costs, Included in
"Depreciation and amortization," was approximately $4.2 million for
1992, 1991 and 1990.
F. Revenue Recognition
Customers' meters are read and bills are rendered on a monthly
cycle basis. Base revenue is recorded during the accounting period
in which the meters are read.
Fuel costs for electric generation are collected through the fuel
component in retail electric rates. The fuel component contained in
electric rates is established by the PSC during semiannual fuel cost
hearings. Any difference between actual fuel cost and that contained
in the fuel component is deferred and included when determining the
fuel cost component during the next semiannual fuel cost hearing.
At December 31, 1992 and 1991 SCE&G had overcollected through
the electric fuel clause component approximately $17.7 million and
$4.1 million, respectively, which are included in "Deferred Credits-
Other."
Customers subject to the gas cost adjustment clause are billed
based on a fixed cost of gas determined by the PSC during annual
gas cost recovery hearings. Any difference between actual gas cost
and that contained in the rates is deferred and included when estab-
lishing gas costs during the next annual gas cost recovery hearing.
At December 31, 1992 and 1991 the Company had undercollected
through the gas cost recovery procedure approximately $6.2 million
and $0.1 million, respectively, which are included in "Deferred
Debits-Other."
In November 1991, the PSC adopted a weather normalization
adjustment (WNA) for SCE&G's and the Company's directly owned
gas distribution systems as part of their firm gas rate schedules for
residential, small commercial and small industrial customers (see
Note 2C).
G. Depreciation and Amortization
Provisions for depreciation are recorded using the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes and are based on theestimated service lives of the various classes of property. The com-
posite weighted-average depreciation rates were as follows:
SCE&G
GENCO
Pipeline Corporation
Aggregate of Above
1992
3.00%
2.63%
2.62%
2.96%

2.59%
2.62%
2.94%
1990
2.97%
2.68%
2.56%
2.93%
Nuclear fuel amortization, which is included in "Fuel used In
electric generation" and is recovered through the fuel cost component
of SCE&G's rates, is recorded using the units-of-production method.
Provisions for amortization of nuclear fuel include amounts neces-
sary to satisfy obligations to the United States Department of Energy
under a contract for disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
The acquisition adjustment relating to the purchase of certain
gas properties in 1982 is being amortized over a 40-year period
using the straight-line method.
H. Nuclear Decommissioning
Decommissioning of Summer Station is presently projected to
commence in the year 2022 when the operating license expires.
The expenditures (on a before-tax basis) related to SCE&G's share of
decommissioning activities are currently estimated (in 2022 dollars,
assuming a 4.5% annual rate of inflation) to be approximately
$545.3 million including partial reclamation costs. SCE&G is pro-
viding for estimated decommissioning costs of its share of Summer
Station over the life of Summer Station. SCE&G currently collects
through rates $1.6 million annually and deposits amounts collected
In an external trust fund in compliance with the financial assurance
requirements of the NRC. Management intends for the fund, includ-
ing earnings, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expendl-
tures on an after-tax basis.
In addition, pursuant to the National Energy Policy Act passed
by Congress in 1992, SCE&G has recorded a liability for its estimat-
ed share of amounts required by the U. S. Department of Energy for
the study of nuclear waste disposal. SCE&G will recover these pay-
ments, totalling $7.1 million at December 31, 1992, through the
fuel cost component of its rates; accordingly, these amounts have
been deferred and are included in "Deferred Debits - Other" and
*Deferred Credits - Other."
I. Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated Federal and
State Income tax returns. Income taxes are allocated to all sub-
sidiarles based on their contributions to consolidated taxable
income.
Because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in
their recognition and measurement of economic events, differences
arise between (1) the amount of taxable income and reported pretax
financial income for a year and (2) the tax bases of assets or liabili-
ties and their reported amounts in the financial statements.
Accordingly, the Company provides deferred Income taxes for sub-
stantially all timing differences, principally accelerated tax deprecia-
tion, except for certain basis differences arising prior to 1982.
Deferred income tax provisions are included in income currently with
corresponding credits or charges to accumulated deferred income
taxes.
Investment tax credits were generally deferred and are being
amortized over the depreciable lives of the respective assets.
In February 1992 the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes."
This Statement requires the use of the "llability method" whereby a
deferred tax liability or asset would be recognized for deferred tax
consequences of all temporary differences. The Statement (1)
requires that a deferred tax liability or asset be adjusted for the effect
of a change in tax law or rates, (2) prohibits net-of-tax accounting
and reporting, and (3) requires recognition of a deferred tax liability
for tax benefits that are flowed through to customers when temporary
differences originate and for the equity component of AFC. Statement
No. 109 Is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1992. The Company does not anticipate that application of this
Staternent will have a significant impact on results of operations or
financial position.
J. Pension Expense
The Company has a noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan covering substantially all permanent employees. Benefits are
based on years of accredited service and the employee's average
annual base earnings received during the last three years of employ-
ment. The Company's policy has been to fund pension costs
accrued to the extent permitted by the applicable Federal income tax
regulations as determined by an independent actuary.
Net periodic pension cost, as determined by an Independent
actuary, for the years ended December 31, 1992, 1991 and 1990
included the following components:

In addition to pension benefits, the Company provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits to active and retired employ-
ees. Currently, such benefits are generally charged to expense when
claims and premiums are paid. The annual cost of providing such
benefits to retired employees is approximately $3.0 million.
In December 1990 the FASB issued Statement No. 106
*Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions. The Statement, which will be effective for calendar year
1993, requires that the cast of postretirement benefits other than
pensions be occrued during the years the employees render the ser-
vice necessary to be eligible for the applicable benefits. The
Company has estimated that its accumulated obligation for these
benefits at December 31, 1992 is approximately $64 million (tran-
sition llability) and the annualized Increase in expenses (net of pay-
ments to current retirees), including the amortization of the transition
liability provided for by the Statement, is approximately $4.7 million.
The Company expects either that most of the increased costs attribut-
able to regulated operations will be recovered currently through rates
or that they will be recorded as a regulatory asset to be recovered
through rates in the future as the costs are pald. In addition, the PSC
or the FERC may require the Company to fund the liability resulting
from implementation of Statement No. 106. The PSC, in other utility
rate decisions, has accepted adoption of Statement No. 106 in set-
ting rates. On December 10, 1992 the PSC issued an accounting
order allowing SCE&G to defer the increased expenses resulting from
adoption of Statement No. 106 through May 31, 1993 awaiting
consideration of their recovery in SCE&G's pending electric rate case
(see Note 2A) and in a future gas rate proceeding. Therefore, the
Company believes this Statement will not have a significant impact
on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
However, there can be no assurance that such recovery will be
granted.
K. Debt Premium, Discount and Expense
Long-term debt premium, discount and expense are being
amortized as components of "Interest on long-term debt, net* over
the terms of the respective debt issues.
L. Environmental
The Company has an environmental assessment program to
Identify and assess current and former operations sites that could
require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, an
estimate is made of the amount of expenditures, if any, necessary to
investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as
additional information becomes available; therefore actual expendi-
tures could significantly differ from the original estimates. Amounts
estimated to date for site assessments and cleanup relate primarily
to regulated operations and have been accrued and deferred pur-
suant to an accounting order from the PSC pending consideration of
their recovery in future rate proceedings. However, there can be no
assurance that such recovery will be granted. Such amounts totalled
$18.3 million at December 31, 1992 and are included In "Deferred
Debits - Other."
M. Gas Futures Contracts
The Company's gas production subsidiary, SCANA Petroleum
Resources, Inc. (SPR), sells gas futures contracts in order to hedge
price risks for a portion of SPR's production. Galns and losses on
such contracts, which are not material, are recognized concurrently
with the revenue from the associated gas sales.
N. Statements of Cash Flows
The Company considers temporary cash investments having
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Temporary cash investments are generally in the form of commercial
paper, certificates of deposit, and repurchase agreements.
O. Reclassifications
Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to
conform with the 1992 presentation.
2. RATE MATTERS:
A. On December 7, 1992 SCE&G filed an application with the
PSC for an increase in retail electric rates. The request proposes a
two phase increase: phase one, expected to commence June 1,
1993, would produce additional revenues of approximately 8.9%,
or $72.9 million annually; and phase two (based on additional con-
struction expenditures for the Cope plant), expected to commence
June 1, 1994, would produce additional revenues of approximately
2.5%, or $20.2 million annually. No assurance can be given as to
the adequacy or timing of such rate rellef. A hearing is scheduled to
begin in March 1993.
B. On September 14, 1992 the PSC issued an order granting
SCE&G a $.25 increase in transit fares from $.50 to $.75 in both
Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina; however, the PSC also
required $.40 fares for low income customers and denied SCE&G's
request to reduce the number of routes and frequency of service. The
new rates were placed into effect on October 5, 1992. SCE&G has
appealed the PSC's order to the Circuit Court.
C. Since November 1, 1991 SCE&G's gas rate schedules for
its residential, small commercial and small Industrial customers
have included a weather normalization adjustment. The WNA mini-
mizes fluctuations in gas revenues due to abnormal weather condi-
tions and has been approved through November 1994 subject to an
annual review by the PSC. The PSC order was based on a return on
common equity of 12.25% (see Note 2G). The PSC also approved
the WNA for the Company's directly owned natural gas distribution
system acquired in 1990. The new rates became effective the first
billing cycle in December 1991. As part of the 1992 annual review
the PSC Issued an order in September 1992 which made certain
modifications in the WNA but did not affect the overall intent.
D. In May 1989 the PSC approved a volumetric and direct
billing method for Pipeline Corporation to recover take-or-pay costs
incurred from its interstate pipeline suppliers pursuant to FERC-
approved final and non-appealable settlements. In December 1992
the South Carolina Supreme Court (Supreme Court) approved
Pipeline Corporation's full recovery of the take-or-pay charges
Imposed by its suppliers and treatment of these charges as a cost of
gas. However, the Supreme Court declared the PSC-approved"purchase deficiency" methodology for recovery of these costs to be
unlawful retroactive ratemaking and remanded the docket to the PSC
to reconsider its recovery methodology. The petitions by the PSC,
the Company and the Consumer Advocate to the Supreme Court for
rehearing were denied. The Company believes that the elimination of
the purchase deficiency method of recovery will affect the timing for
recovery of take-or-pay charges and shift the allocations among
Pipeline Corporation's customers (including SCE&G) but that all
such charges should be ultimately recovered.
E. On August 8, 1990 the PSC issued an order, effective
November 1, 1990, approving changes in Pipeline Corporation's
gas rate design for sales for resale service and upholding the value-
of-service method of regulation for its direct industrial service.
Direct Industrial customers seeking "cost-of-service" based rates ini-
flated two separate appeals to the Circuit Court, which reversed and
remanded to the PSC Its August 8, 1990 order. Pipeline Corporation
has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. Although Pipeline
Corporation believes that the decision of the PSC lies within the dis-
cretion granted it by the laws of South Carolina, the outcome is
uncertain.
F. On July 3, 1989 the PSC granted SCE&G approximately
$21.9 million of a requested $27.2 million annual increase in retall
electric revenues based upon an allowed return on common equity
of 13.25%. The Consumer Advocate appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court (see Note 21) which, on August 31, 1992, found that
the evidence in the record of that case did not support a return on
common equily higher than 13.0% and remanded to the PSC a por-
tion of Its July 1989 order for a determination of the proper return on
common equity consistent with the Supreme Court's opinion. On
January 19, 1993 the PSC Issued an order allowing a return on
common equity of 13.0%, approving a refund based on the differ-
ence in rates created by the difference between the 13.0% and the
13.25% return on common equity and making other non-material
adjustments to the calculation of cost-of-service. SCE&G has peti-
tioned the PSC for rehearing and reconsideration of the new adjust-
ments to cost of service. The annual effect on electric revenues of
the decrease in rate of return is approximately $3.7 million. The
estimated amount of accumulated refund through December 31,
1992, before Interest and income taxes, Is approximately $14.6 mil-
Ilon, and has been charged against 1992 "Electric Revenues." The
refund plus interest will be made during 1993.
G. On November 28, 1989 the PSC granted SCE&G an
Increase in firm retail natural gas rates, effective November 30,
1989, designed to increase annual revenues by $10.1 million, or
89.5% out of the requested increase of approximately $11.3 mll-
lion. In Its order the PSC authorized a 12.75% return on common
equity. The Consumer Advocate appealed to the Supreme Court
which on August 31, 1992 remanded the order to the PSC for rede-
termination of the proper amount of litigation expenses to include in
the test period. In January 1993 the PSC reduced the amount of liti-
gation expense and ordered a refund which SCE&G estimates will be
approximately $163,000.
H. The PSC has completed its Investigation of the financial
relationships between SCE&G and its affiliates. On November 13,
1992 the PSC issued a final order establishing certain reporting
requirements for SCE&G and its regulated affiliates, including the
Company, and changing the method of allocating SCANA overhead
charges to its subsidiaries. The Company does not believe the new
reporting obligations or allocations will have a material effect on its
financial position or results of operations.
1. In the Consumer Advocate's appeal to the Supreme Court of
the PSC order dated July 1, 1987, concerning restoration to
SCE&G's rate base of the net production Investment associated with
400 MW of electric generating capacity previously removed by the
PSC in its order dated March 2, 1984, the Supreme Court upheld
restoration of the 400 MW to rate base. The Supreme Court also
remanded the case to the PSC for factual finding on the prudence of
the derating of 69 MW of SCE&G's total production capacity and the
effect, if any, of the deratings on depreciation and carrying cost
issues affecting its rate base and cost of service. The PSC issued an
order reaffirming its decision and stating in its findings and conclu-
slons that the 69 MW rerating had no effect on rate base and cost of
service. The Consumer Advocate then oppeated this order to the
Circuit Court which consolidated this appeal with the appeal of the
electric rate order described in Note 2F above and affirmed the PSC
order. The Consumer Advocate appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court which, in an opinion dated August 31, 1992,
affirmed the order of the PSC.
3. GAIN ON SALE OF INVESTMENT:
On August 14, 1990 MCI Communications Corporation
ocquired all outstanding shares of Telecom USA common stock for
cash of $42 per share. Through its investment in Telecom Partners,
MPX Systems, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company)
owned approximately 3.3 million shares of Telecom USA common
stock at the date of acquisition. The gain from the sale of the stock,
net of Income taxes, was approximately $46.1 million, or $1.13 per
share of the Company's common stock, and was reported in the
third quarter of 1990.
4. LONG-TERM DEBT:
The annual amounts of long-term debt maturities, including the
amounts due under nuclear and fossil fuel agreements (see Note 5),
and sinking fund requirements for the years 1993 through 1997 are
summarized as follows:

Approximately $10.9 million of the current portion of long-term
debt for 1993 may be satisfied by either deposit and cancellation of
bonds Issued upon the basis of property additions or bond retirement
credits, or by deposit of cash with the Trustee.
On July 13, 1992 the Company issued $42.4 million of medi-
um-term notes, 7.17%, due July 15, 1999. On October 8, 1992
the Company Issued $30.0 million of medlum-term notes, 6.60%,
due October 8, 1999. The proceeds from the sales of these securi-
tles, which are unsecured, were used in the funding of nonutllity sub-
sidiary activities.
On August 21, 1992 GENCO Issued a $78.5 million, 7.78%
note, due December 31, 2011. The proceeds from the Issuance
were used to refund a $63.5 million loan due December 31, 1992,
to repay advances from the parent and for construction expenditures.22
SCE&G's Pollution Control Bonds (which do not include the
5.95% Series, due 2003) are secured by like principal amounts of
its First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds. On September 1, 1992
SCE&G complated a Fixed Rate Conversion and Reoffering of $63.1
million and $4.4 million of such Pollution Control Bonds to bear
interest at the rate of 6.50% and 6.60%, respectively. The bonds
mature September 1, 2014.
On October 1, 1992 GENCO converted Pollution Control Bonds
of $35.85 million to a fixed interest rate of 6.50%. The bonds,
which are joint obligations of SCE&G and GENCO, are unsecured
and mature in 2014.
In January 1993 the Company arranged for an unsecured bank
loan in the principal amount of $60 million, due January 14, 1994.
The Interest rate is the three month LIBOR rate plus 30 basis points
and is reset quarterly. Proceeds from the loan were used to repay
$60 million in bank notes due January 15, 1993; accordingly, such
notes are included in long-term debt at December 31, 1992.
Substantially all utility plant and fuel inventories are pledged as
collateral in connection with long-term debt.
5. FUEL FINANCINGS:
Nuclear and fossil fuel inventories are financed through the
issuance of short-term commercial paper. These short-term borrow-
ings are supported by irrevocable revolving credit agreements which
expire July 31, 1995 (nuclear) and July 31, 1994 (fossil).
Accordingly, the amounts outstanding have been included in long-
term debt. The credit agreements provide for maximum amounts
($75 million related to nuclear fuel and $25 million related to fossil
fuel) that may be outstanding at any time.
Commercial paper outstanding and weighted average interest
rates at December 31, 1992 and 1991 are as follows:

In 1991 the Company registered 2,000,000 shares of
Common Stock to be issued under its Stock Purchase-Savings Plan
and 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock to be issued under the
terms of its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. During
1992 422,082 and 404,222 shares totalling $17.7 million and
$16.9 million were issued pursuant to these plans, respectively.
On November 18, 1992 the Company issued 2,300,000
shares of common stock with net proceeds totalling $89.9 million.
The proceeds have been contributed by the Company to the common
stock equity of SCE&G and used by SCE&G for general corporate
purposes, including the financing of its construction program and the
reduction of short-term indebtedness incurred for such purposes.
The Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company do not
limit the dividends that may be payable on its common stock.
However, the Restated Articles of Incorporation of SCE&G and the
Indenture underlying certain of its bond issues contain provisions
that may limit the payment of cash dividends on common stock. In
addition, with respect to hydroelectric projects, the Federal Power Act
may require the appropriation of a portion of the earnings therefrom.
At December 31, 1992 approximately $10.2 million of retained
earnings were restricted as to payment of cash dividends on com-
mon stock.
Cash dividends on common stock were declared at an annual
rate per share of $2.68, $2.62 and $2.52 for 1992, 1991 and
1990, respectively.
7. PREFERRED STOCK (Subject to Purchase or Sinking Funds):
The call premium of the respective series of preferred stock In
no case exceeds the amount of the annual dividend. Retirements
under sinking fund requirements are at par values.
At any time when dividends have not been paid in full or
declared and set apart for payment on all series of preferred stock,
SCE&G may not redeem any shares of preferred stock (unless all
shares of preferred stock then outstanding are redeemed) or pur-
chase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of preferred stock
except in accordance with an offer made to all holders of preferred
stock. SCE&G may not redeem any shares of preferred stock (unless
all shares of preferred stack then outstanding are redeemed) or pur-
chase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of preferred stock
(except out of monies set aside as purchase funds or sinking funds
for one or more series of preferred stock) at any time when it is in
default under the provisions of the purchase fund or sinking fund for
any series of preferred stock.
The aggregate annual amounts of purchase fund or sinking
fund requirements for preferred stock for the years 1993 through
1997 are summarized as follows:

The Information presented herein is based on pertinent information
available to the Company as of December 31, 1992. Although the
Company is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect
the estimated fair value amounts, such financial instruments have
not been comprehensively revalued since December 31, 1992, and
the current estimated fair value may differ significantly from the esti-
mated fair value at that date. The following methods and assump-
tions were used to estimate the fair value of the above classes of
financial instruments:
1993 $107,920
1994
Cash and temporary cash investments, including commercial
paper, repurchase agreements, treasury bills, and notes are valued
at their carrying amount.
Fair values of investments and long-term debt are based on
quoted market prices for similar instruments, or for those instruments
for which there are no quoted market prices available, fair values are
based on not present value calculations. Investments which are not
considered to be financial instruments (goodwill) have been exclud-
ed from the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Settlement of
long term debt may not be possible or may not be a prudent man-
agement decision.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
A. Construction
SCE&G has entered into a contract with Duke/Fluor Daniel to
design, engineer and build a 385 MW coal-fired electric generating
plant near Cope, South Carolina in Orangeburg County. Construction
of the plant begon on November 12, 1992 with commercial opera-
tion expected in the spring of 1996. The estimated price of the Cope
plant, excluding financing costs and AFC but including an allowance
for escalation, is $450 million. In addition, the transmission lines for
interconnection with the Company's system are expected to cost $26
million. On April 7, 1992 the PSC approved a Certificate of
Environmental Compatibility and Public Convenience and Necessity
regarding the plant construction.
Under the Duke/Fluor Daniel contract SCE&G must make speci-
fied monthly minimum payments. These minimum payments do not
include amounts for inflation on a certain portion of the contract
which is subject to escalation (approximately 34% of the total con-
tract amount). The aggregate amount of such required minimum
payments remaining at December 31, 1992 is as follows (in thou-
sands):
SCE&G paid $35,798,857 under the contract in 1992.
B. Nuclear Insurance
The Price-Anderson Indemnification Act, which deals with public
liability for a nuclear incident, currently establishes the liability limit
for third-party claims associated with any nuclear incident at $7.8
billion. Each reactor licensee is currently liable for up to $66.2 mil-
lion per reactor owned for each nuclear incident occurring at any
reactor in the United States, provided that not more than $10 million
of the liability per reactor would be assessed per year. SCE&G's
maximum assessment, based on its two-thirds ownership of
Summer Station, would be approximately $44.1 mililon per incident,
but not more than $6.7 million per year.
SCE&G currently maintains policies (for itself and on behalf of
the PSA) with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL) and
American Nuclear Insurers (ANI) providing combined property and
decontamination Insurance coverage of $1.325 billion for any loss-
es in excess of $500 million pursuant to existing primary coverages
(with ANI) on Summer Station. SCE&G pays annual premiums and,
in addition, could be assessed a retroactive premium not to exceed
7 1/2 times its annual premlum in the event of property damage loss
to any nuclear generating facilities covered by NEIL. Based on the
current annual premium, this retroactive premium would not exceed
$3.9 million.
To the extent that insurable claims for property damage, decont-
amination, repair and replacement and other costs and expenses
arising from a nuclear incident at Summer Station exceed the policy
limits of insurance, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavail-
able in the future, and to the extent that SCE&G's rates would not
recover the cost of any purchased replacement power, SCE&G will
retain the risk of loss as a self-insurer. SCE&G hos no reason to
anticipate a serious nuclear incident at Summer Station. If such an
Incident were to occur, it could have a materially adverse impact on
the Company's financial position.
C. Litigation
SCE&G, acting for itself and the PSA (as co-owners of the 885
MW Summer Station), filed an action against Westinghouse Electric
Corporation (Westinghouse) on March 22, 1990 In the U.S. District
Court for South Carolina. SCE&G is seeking a judgment that
Westinghouse is obligated to correct the defects in the steam genera-
tors supplied by Westinghouse to Summer Station that are defective
in design, workmanship and materials at no cost to SCE&G, and for
actual and punitive damages and treble damages in an amount to
be determined.
D. Environmental
As described in Note 1L, the Company has an environmental
assessment program to identify and assess current and former oper-
ations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site
assessments are initiated, an estimate is made of the amount of
expenditures, if any, necessary to investigate and clean up each site.
These estimates are refined as additional information becomes avail-
able, therefore actual expenditures could significantly differ from the
original estimates. Amounts estimated to date for site assessments
and cleanup relate primarily to regulated operations and have been
accrued and deferred pursuant to an accounting order from the PSC
pending consideration of their recovery in future rate proceedings.
However, there can be no assurance that such recovery will be
granted.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The cash requirements of the Company arise primarlly from
SCE&G's operational needs and its construction program. The
Company also raises external capital as required to fund the activities of
investments of its non-regulated subsidiaries. The ability of the
Company's regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment,
as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will
depend upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on
reasonable terms. The Company's regulated subsidiaries recover the
costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates
for regulated services are based on historical costs. As inflation occurs
and SCE&G expands its construction program it is necessary to seek
increases in rates. As discussed in Note 2A of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, on December 7, 1992 SCE&G filed a formal appli-
cation with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSC) to
increase electric rates. SCE&G had not filed a request for an increase in
electric rates since 1989. The Company's future financial position and
results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidiaries' ability
to obtain adequate and timely rate relief.
As a result of continuing customer growth, SCE&G has entered into
a contract with Duke/Fluor Daniel to design, engineer and build a 385
MW coal-fired electric generating plant near Cope, South Carolina in
Orangeburg County. Construction of the plant began on November 12,
1992 with commercial operation expected in the spring of 1996. The
estimated price of the Cope plant, excluding financing costs and
allowance for funds used during construction (AFC) but including on
allowance for escalation, is $450 million. In addition, the transmission
lines for interconnection with the Company's system are expected to cost
$26 million. Until the completion of the new plant, SCE&G plans to pur-
chase power, as necessary, to maintain its reserve margins.
Approximately 48.4% of total cash requirements (including divi-
dends) was provided from internal sources in 1992 as compared to
47.5% in 1991.
In January 1992 the Company renewed for one year unsecured
bank loans totalling $80 million. On July 15, 1992 $20 million was
repald using proceeds from the issuance of medium-term notes. In
January 1993 the Company arranged for an unsecured bank loan in the
principal amount of $60 mil-
lion, due January 14, 1994, to
refinance the $60 million bal-
ance. The interest rate is the
three month LIBOR plus 30
basis points and is reset quar-
terly.

The Company has in
effect a medium-term note pro-
gram for the issuance from
time to time of unsecured medi-
um-term debt securities. The
proceeds from the sales of
these securities may be used to
fund additional business activi-
ties in nonutility subsidiaries, to
reduce short-term debt Incurred
in connection therewith or for
general corporate purposes. In
1992 the Company Issued $72.4 million of such medium-term notes.
The proceeds from the sales of these securities were used for the funding
of nonutility subsidlary activities. At December 31, 1992 the Company
has available for issuance $127.6 million under this program.
On August 21, 1992 GENCO issued a $78.5 million, 7.78% note
due December 31, 2011. The proceeds from the issuance of the note
were used to refund a $63.5 million loan due December 31, 1992, to
repay advances from the parent and for construction expenditures.
During 1992, SCE&G and GENCO converted $67.5 million and
$35.85 million respectively, of Pollution Control Bonds to fixed rates.
SCE&G's first mortgage bond indenture contains provisions pro-
hibiting the issuance of additional bonds unless net earnings (as therein
defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 15 months prior to the
month of issuance is at least twice the annual interest requirements on
all bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December
31, 1992 the Bond Ratio was 2.98. The Issuance of additional bonds
is restricted also to an additional principal amount equal to 60% of
unfunded net property additions (which unfunded property additions
totalled approximately $481.7 million at March 31, 1992), bonds
issued on the basis of retirements of bonds (which retirement credits
totalled $10.9 million at December 31, 1992) and bonds issued on the
basis of cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G's Restated Articles of
Incorporation prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock
without consent of the preferred stockholders unless net earnings (as
defined therein) for the 12 consecutive months Immediately preceding
the month of issuance is at least one and one-half times the aggregate
of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements
(Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 1992 the
Preferred Stock Ratio was 2.09.
SCE&G has authorized a Collateral Trust Mortgage (New Mortgage)
under which its future mortgage-backed debt will be issued. New Bonds
are expected to be issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like
principal amount of bonds (Class A Bonds) issued under the existing
SCE&G First Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated April 1, 1945 (1945
Indenture), which have been deposited with the trustee of the New
Mortgage, until such time as all presently outstanding Class A Bonds
are retired. Thereafter, New Bonds will be issuable on the basis of prop-
erty additions to be limited to 70% of the original cost of electric and
common plant properties (compared to 60% of value for Class A Bonds
under the 1945 Indenture), cash deposited with the trustee, and retire-
ment of New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New
Mortgage only If Adjusted Net Earnings (as defined) for 12 consecutive
months out of an 18 month period are at least twice the annual interest
requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and
New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). SCE&G has autho-
rized issuance of up to $300 million of New Bonds and issuance and
deposit of a like amount of Class A Bonds. The pro forma New Bond
Ratlo was 2.30 for the year ended December 31, 1992. SCE&G
expects to place the New Mortgage in effect by early spring 1993 to be
able to issue and sell New Bands.
Prior to placing the New Mortgage into effect, SCE&G could issue
up to an additional $300 million of Class A Bonds to finance its con-
struction program.
Without the consent of at least a majority of the total voting power
of SCE&G's preferred stock, SCE&G may not issue or assume any unse-
cured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principalamount of all such unsecured Indebtedness would exceed 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&G's secured Indebtedness and
capital and surplus; provided, however, that no such consent shall be
required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, Interest and
premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes.
On November 18, 1992 the Company Issued 2,300,000 shares
of common stock with net proceeds totalling $89.9 million. The pro-
ceeds have been contributed by the Company to the common stock
equlty of SCE&G and used by SCE&G for general corporate purposes,
including the financing of its construction program and the reduction of
short-term indebtedness incurred for such purposes.
During 1992 the Company issued 404,222 shares of the
Company's common stock under the Company's Dividend Reinvestment
and Stock Purchase Plan (DRP). Effective for 1993 and subsequent
years, the Company has amended the DRP to allow direct purchases of
shares by nonstockholders and to increase amounts of stock pur-
chasable to $36,000 in any twelve month period. In addition, the
Company Issued 422,082 shares of its common stock pursuant to its
Stock Purchase-Savings Plan (SPSP). The Company has authorized
and reserved for issuance 595,778 and 1,577,918 shares of common
stock pursuant to the DRP and the SPSP, respectively.
Pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act, SCE&G and
GENCO must obtain FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness.
The FERC has authorized SCE&G to issue up to $200 million of unse-
cured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of 12
months or less but not later than December 31, 1995. GENCO has not
sought such authorization.
The Company has $153.9 million authorized lines of credit and
has unused lines of credit of $127.8 million at December 31, 1992.
The Company anticipates that Its 1993 cash requirements will be
met through internally generated funds (approximately 50%, subject to
rate rellet), the sales of additional equity securities and the incurrence of
additional short-term and long-term indebtedness. The timing and
amount of such financing will depend upon market conditions, the ade-
quacy and timing of rate rellef, and other factors. Actual 1993 expendi-
tures may vary from the estimates set forth above due to factors such as
inflation and economic conditions, regulation and legislation, rates of
load growth, environmental protection standards and the cost and avail-
ability of capital.
The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources
of financing to meet Its projected cash requirements.
Environmental Mutters
The Clean Air Act requires electric utilities to reduce substantially
emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide by the year 2000. These
requirements are being phased in over two periods. The first phase has
a compliance date of January 1, 1995 and the second, January 1,
2000. The Company meets all requirements of Phase ) and therefore
will not have to implement changes until compliance with Phase II
requirements is necessary. The Company then may reduce sulfur diox-
ide emissions through the burning of gas or lower sullur coal and the
addition of scrubbers to coal-fired generating units. Low nitrogen oxide
burners may be Installed to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.
The Company is working on a detailed compliance plan that must
be flied with and approved by the Environmental Protection Agency by
1995. The Company currently estimates that the implementation of
Phase II would require capital expenditures of $144.0 million over the
1993-1997 period (excluding dollars for new construction) and an
Increased operation and maintenance cost of $14.4 millon per year (in
1992 dollars). To meet compliance requirements beyond the year
2000, the Company anticipates total capital expenditures of $198.5
million (in 1992 dollars).
As described in Note 1L of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company has an environmental assessment program to
identify and assess current and former operations sites that could
require environmental cleanup. As site dosessments are Intflated, an
estimate is made of the amount of expenditures, if any, necessary to
investigate and clean up each sile. These estimates are refined as oddi-
tional information becomes avaliable; therefore actual expenditures
could significantly differ from the original estimates. Amounts estimated
to date ($18.3 million) for site assessments and cleanup relate primari-
ly to regulated operations and have been accrued and deferred pursuant
to an accounting order from the PSC pending consideration of their
recovery In future rate proceedings. However, there can be no assur-
ance that such recovery will be granted. Estimates to date include,
among other things, the matters discussed in the following paragraphs.
The Company and Its principal subsidiary, SCE&G, each own two
decommissioned manufactured gas plant sites which contain residues
of by-product chemicals. The Company and SCE&G have each main-
tained an active review of their respective sites to monitor the nature and
extent of the residual contamination.
In September 1992 the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) notified SCE&G, the City of Charleston and the Charleston
Housing Authority of their potential liability for the investigation and
cleanup of the Calhoun Park Area Site (Site) In Charleston, South
Carolina. The Site encompasses approximately 18 acres and Includes
properties which were the locations for one of SCE&G's decommissioned
manufactured gas plants, o wood preserving (creosote) plant, and other
industrial companies. The Site has not been placed on the National
Priority List, but may be added before cleanup is initiated. The potential-
ly responsible parties (PRP) have agreed with EPA to participate in an
innovative approach to Site investigation and cleanup called "Superfund
Accelerated Cleanup Model," allowing the pre-cleanup site Investigations
process to be compressed significantly. The PRPS have negotiated an
administrative order by consent for the conduct of a Remedial
Investigation/Feasibility Study and a corresponding Scope of Work.
Final site investigation and cleanup costs have yet to be determined by
the EPA and no allocation of costs among the PRPS has been made.
In December 1989 SCE&G consented to become a PRP under the
Superfund Act for cleanup of residue removed from one of its manufac-
tured gas plant sites and taken by a salvage company to the Macon-
Dockery waste disposal site near Rockingham, North Carolina. In
February 1990 SCE&G paid $125,000 to the EPA for its share of past
response costs. On January 9, 1992 the EPA notified SCE&G and the
other PRPS of its selected cleanup alternative for the Macon-Dockery
site. Agreements with the EPA set SCE&G's share of costs at approxi-
mately $1,115,000 over a 30 year period.
In order to gain protection against potential litigation by other
PRPs, in January 1992 SCE&G made a good faith offer to pay $16,136
to the EPA to participate as a de minimis PRP in financing a Remedial
Design/Remedial Action (RD/RA) for the Yellow Water Road Superfund
Site near Jacksonville, Florida, on the condition that EPA and the other
necessary PRPS reach an agreement on a consent degree for the con-duct of the RD/RA. SCE&G does not believe it has any responsibility for
this site.
SCE&G has been listed as a PRP, for which no accruals have been
made, In proceedings for two other waste disposal sites as detailed
below. SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at these sites will
have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.
In 1988 SCE&G was listed as a PRP under the Superfund Act for
Investigation and cleanup at Elllott's Auto Parts, formerly Saline County
Salvage Site, located in Benton, Arkansas. In 1988, SCE&G Informed
EPA that SCE&G had no Information it had ever done business with any
of the site owners, operators or transporters. On December 28, 1992,
SCE&G reiterated its position to the PRP Steering Committee.
In 1991 SCE&G was listed as a PRP under the Superfund Act for
cleanup at a landfill owned by Lexington County in South Carolina. The
county has stated that it will assume responsibility for any cleanup.
Accordingly, SCE&G believes that it will have no financial responsibility
for the site; however it will participate in proceedings to determine the
precise status of the landfill. The county has not yet estimated the total
costs of cleanup of the site.
Litigation
The steam generator tubes at the 885 MW V. C. Summer Nuclear
Station (Summer Station) were supplied by Westinghouse Electric
Corporation (Westinghouse) and have experienced stress corrosion
cracking, which causes deterioration and degradation of the tubes and
reduces the station's capacity. SCE&G has decided to replace the steam
generators at the scheduled refueling outage in 1994, significantly prior
to the end of their intended 40-year service life. SCE&G estimates the
outage to replace the steam generators will take approximately 100
days and Its two-thirds share of the replacement cost could be as much
as $80 million, excluding AFC and replacement power costs.
SCE&G, acting for itself and The South Carolina Public Service
Authority, as co-owners of Summer Station, has filed an action against
Westinghouse in the U. S. District Court for South Caroling seeking a
judgment that Westinghouse is obligated to correct the defects in the
steam generators at no cost to SCE&G, and for actual and punitive dom-
ages and treble damages in an amount to be determined.
Regulatory Matters
On December 7, 1992 SCE&G filed an application with the PSC for
an increase in retail electric rates. The request proposes a two phase
increase: phose one, expected to commence June 1, 1993, 8.9% in
additional revenues, or $72.9 million annually; and phase two (based
on additional construction expenditures for the Cope plant), expected to
commence June 1, 1994, 2.5% in additional revenues, or $20.2 mil-
lion annually. No assurance can be given as to the adequacy or timing
of such rate relief. A hearing is scheduled to begin in March 1993.
In December 1990 the FASB issued Statement No. 106
"Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Thon
Pensions. The Statement, which will be effective for calendar year
1993, requires that the cost of postretirement benefits other than pen-
sions be accrued during the years the employees render the service nec-
essary to be eligible for the applicable benefits. The Company has esti-
mated that its accumulated obligation for these benefits at December
31, 1992 is approximately $64 million (transition liability) and the
annualized increase in expenses (net of payments to current retirees of
approximately $3.0 million), including the amortization of the transition
liability provided for by the Statement, is approximately $4.7 million.
The Company expects either that most of the increased costs attributable
to regulated operations will be recovered currently through rates or that
they will be recorded as a regulatory asset to be recovered through rates
in the future as the costs are paid. The PSC, in other utility rate deci-
sions, has accepted adoption of Statement No. 106 In setting rates. In
addition, the PSC or the FERC may require the Company to fund the lia-
bility resulting from implementation of Statement No. 106. On
December 10, 1992 the PSC Issued an accounting order allowing
SCE&G to defer the increased expenses resulting from adoption of
Statement No. 106 through May 31, 1993 awalting consideration of
their recovery in SCE&G's pending electric rate case (see Note 2A of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and in a future gas rate
case. Therefore, the Company believes this Statement will not have a
significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations. However, there can be no assurance that such recovery will
be granted.
The Company's regulated business operations are likely to be
impacted by the National Energy Policy Act and FERC Order No. 636.
However, in the opinion of the Company, It will be able to successfully
meet the challenges of these altered business cilmates.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Earnings and Dividends
Earnings per share of common stock, the percent increase
(decrease) from the previous year and the rate of return earned on com-
mon equity for the years 1990 through 1992 were as follows:
Earnings per share

46.1%
18.1%
10.1%
13.2%
• 1992 In 1992 earnings per share and return on common equity
decreased primarily due to the recording of a $11.1 million (after inter-
est and income taxes) reserve against earnings related to the August
31, 1992 retali electric rate ruling from the South Carolina Supreme
Court (see Note 2F of Notes to the Consolldated Financial Statements)
and increases in other operating and interest expenses.
* 1991 Earnings per share and return on common equity decreased in
1991 from 1990 primarily as a result of the sale of the Company's
investment in Telecom USA to MCI on August 14, 1990. The gain, net
of tax, from the sale of the stock owned by MPX Systems, Inc. was
approximately $46.1 million, or $1.13 per share of the Company's
common stock. The effects of increases in the electric and gas margins
for 1991 were more than offset by higher other operating expenses.
AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of
both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is
shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capi-
talized. Both the equity and the debt portions of AFC are noncash items
of nanoperating income which have the effect of increasing reported net
income. AFC represented approximately 8% of net income in 1992,
6% in 1991 and 3% in 1990.
In 1992 the Company's Board of Directors raised the quarterly
cash dividend on common stock to 67 cents per share from 65.5 cents
per share. The increase, effective with the dividend payable on April 1,1992, raised the indicated annual dividend rate to $2.68 per share from
$2.62. The Company has increased the dividend rate on its common
stock in 39 of the last 40 years.
Electric Operations
* 1902 The 1992 electric margin decreased from 1991 due to the
recording of a $14.6 million reserve, before interest and Income taxes,
related to the August 31, 1992 ruling from the South Carolina Supreme
Court (see Note 2F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and
a $1.9 million billing-related litigation settlement included in 1991 elec-
tric operating revenues.
• 1001 The electric margin Increase from 1990 to 1991 is primarily
due to Increased KWH residential and commercial sales as a result of
residential and commercial customer growth and due to the recording of
the billing-related litigation settlement mentioned above.
An increase in the number of electric customers of 8,240 resulted in
an all-time peak demand record of 3,380 MW on July 13, 1992. The
previous years' record of 3,300 MW was set on July 23, 1991.
Gas Operations
* 1992 The gas margin for 1992 increased from 1991 as a result of
recoveries of $4.2 million allowed under a weather normalization
adjustment which became effective the first billing cycle in December
1991, increases in residential usage due to cooler weather during 1992
and increased transportation volumes.
• 1991 The Increase in the 1991 gas margin is primarlly due to
increased transportation volumes and increased natural gas sales to
higher margin residential and commercial customers as a result of resi-
dential and commercial customer growth.
Dekatherm sales Increased 66,921 from 1991 to 1992 due to an
Increase of 5,334 customers and periods of cooler weather.
Other Operating Expenses
Other operation and maintenance expenses Increased for 1992 prl-

increases in nuclear regulatory fees, and nuclear and transmission sys-
tems maintenance. The Increase in 1991 in other operation and main-
tenance expenses is primarily due to increases in employee-related
expenses and an increase in uncollectible customer accounts. The
Increase in depreciation and amortization expense for 1992 and 1991
reflects additiona to plant in service. Income taxes for 1992 decreased
primarily due to the tax impact of the role refund (see Note 2F of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements) and to other decreases in income.
Income taxes for 1991 remained relatively unchanged from 1990.
Other taxes increased for 1992 and 1991 primarily from higher property
taxes caused by property additions and increased milliage rates. In
addition to the above, other takes for 1992 Increased due to state
license fees.
Interest On Long-Term Debt
• 1992 Interest on long-term debt increased approximately $4.4 million
in 1992 compared to 1991 due to the issuances of the $145 million
and $155 milllan of First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds on July 24,
1991 and August 29, 1991, respectively, which more than offset the
decreases in interest expense resulting from the repayment of debt and
lower interest rates on remaining debt.
• 1901 Interest on long-term debt increased approximately $3.4 million
In 1991 compared to 1990. The Increase for 1991 resulted primarily
from five months of interest related to the above mentioned bond
issuances, which more than offset the elimination of interest expense on
the debt repaid from the proceeds.
Other Interest Expense
* 1992 Other Interest expense increased from 1991 to 1992 primarily
as a result of Interest accrued on the provision for rate refunds (see Note
2F of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) which was partially
offset by decreases in sales of commercial paper.
• 1991 Other interest expense decreased $2.9 million in 1991 com-
