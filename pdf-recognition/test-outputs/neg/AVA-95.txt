LETTER TO OUR
SHAREHOLDERS
For our company, 1995 was an exceptional year.
We posted improved results in nearly every aspect of
4]
our business. We achieved record revenues of $755
higher by 14 percent at $78 million. Our earnings per
share grew by 10 percent to $1.41. I am enormously proud of what our team of employees accomplished through their
dedication to providing superior value to our shareholders and our customers.
While pleased with our solid performance, we were deeply disappointed by the delay in completing our pro-
posed merger with Sierra Pacific Resources. We had fully expected to be operating as a new company under a new
name Altus Corporation by the end of 1995. But, late in the year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
voted to conduct hearings on the merger. This news was as surprising as it was disheartening, particularly since we
had received all required state regulatory approvals for the merger. We are striving for prompt action at the federal
level and are doing all we can to foster a common understanding of key issues.
We are also pursuing other opportunities in response to the profound change that is reshaping our industry. We
have crafted an operating plan - driven by the fundamentals of business growth, results improvement and exceptional
customer service that will allow us to build on our success. In support of our plan, we have realigned responsibilities
among our officer team. By refocusing their collective energy, we will be better able to anticipate change, provide swift
million, and our net income for common stock was
In meeting the challenges of change, we begin by building on the foundation of our business success: Our envi-
able position as one of the nation's lowest-cost providers of energy. We hold a distinct price advantage over almost all
our competitors, which will allow us to capture the many opportunities that a deregulated marketplace will offer.An example is our wholesale energy business, where we have greatly
strengthened our competitive position. Wholesale electric revenues were up by
20 percent last year and, based on contracts already in place, we expect revenues
from this business to nearly double by 1997. We will also begin marketing whole-
sale energy services nationally as we seek to build on our established market
position in the western United States.
With the full blossoming of deregulation in our industry on the horizon, our retail energy business is also taking
on a national focus. While continuing to deliver value to our existing customers, we are pursuing opportunities outside
the traditional boundaries of our service area. To carry out this plan, we have introduced WWP Energy Solutions, a full-
service energy entity with a focus on providing customers with a broader range of services.
Measured and cost-effective customer growth - whether adding customers through service extensions or through
service area acquisition - continues as an important strategy. We have added 75,000 customers through acquisitions in the
past five years - including 10,000 in 1995 and we will continue to seek the right opportunities for further expansion.
Pentzer Corporation, responsible for the majority of our non-utility investments, will continue to make a valuable
contribution to our overall corporate performance. Our non-utility businesses generated $15 million in net income in
1995, a year-to-year improvement of 9 percent, and contributed $0.27 per share to earnings.
We fully recognize that our success in this changing industry hinges on the imagination and energy of our
employees. For that reason, we have placed an emphasis on fostering continuous employee learning and creating a
more flexible and multi-skilled workforce.
The coming year will be filled with challenges. Our promise to you is to build a stronger company by delivering
innovative solutions. I will keep you informed of our progress.

REFINING OUR
PERFORMANCE
With the rush of change upon our industry, clearly we have to pull free
of any settled position and prepare to move in the direction of opportunities as
they arise. Pressing toward improvement cannot be a periodic focus. It must
be our perpetual state.
Can we streamline this process to save effort and cost? What tools do
we need? What training is necessary? Who should be on the team that takes
on this task? These are the questions of redesign. And they are questions that
are challenging us to define priorities and realign work around customer
needs. In 1996, virtually every part of our company will come under this kind of analysis.
Our people have always been our greatest strength. Now we're equipping them to do the work even better.
Furthermore, our plants and other facilities have always been highly productive, but we're looking for additional
gains. Likewise our service delivery systems. Using technology, we've developed work management systems that
reduce paperwork and more quickly get our people where they're needed most, serving customers.
As we strive toward better and better performance, our goal is always to be a more productive and a more respon-
sive organization. This is a delicate balance. Customer service can never be sacrificed to efficiency and productivity.
Every day, we're improving our business, matching our promises to reality and delivering on our commitments.

Our company's service area covers 30,000 square miles, and we have utility operations în five western states.
We currently serve nearly 290,000 electric customers in eastern Washington and northern Idaho, and we provide nat-
ural gas service to nearly 225,000 customers in parts of four states - Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California.
We are one of the nation's lowest-cost producers and providers of energy services. Our diverse mix of electric
resources includes hydropower and coal, gas, and wood-waste combustion. Our low-cost resources, combined with
strategic access to regional electric transmission systems, have played a crucial role in our ongoing success in the
wholesale energy marketplace. Because we contract with five natural gas pipelines and have access to cost-effective
domestic and Canadian gas supplies, we are able to capture market opportunities that benefit our customers.
Sierra Pacific Power Company, the utility operating subsidiary of our proposed merger partner, Sierra Pacific
Resources, provides electric service to more than 270.000 customers across a 50,000 square-mile area of norther
Nevada and northeastern California. Sierra Pacific also provides natural gas service to 92,000 customers and water
service to 61,000 customers in the Reno/Sparks area of Nevada.

financial condition and results of operations
lysis estatsitions
The Company is primarily engaged as a utility in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electric
energy and the purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. Natural gas operations are affected to a significant
degree by weather conditions and customer growth. The Company's electric operations are highly dependent upon hydroelectric
generation for its power supply. As a result, the electric operations of the Company are significantly affected by weather and
streamflow conditions and, to a lesser degree, by customer growth. Revenues from the sale of surplus energy to other utilities
and the cost of power purchases vary from year to year depending on streamflow conditions and the wholesale power market.
The wholesale power market in the Northwest region is affected by several factors, including the availability of water for
hydroelectric generation, the availability of base load plants in the region and the demand for power in the Southwest region.
Other factors affecting the wholesale power market include new entrants in the wholesale market, such as power brokers and
marketers, and competition from low cost generation being developed by independent power producers. Usage by retail
customers varies from year to year primarily as a result of weather conditions, the economy in the Company's service area,
customer growth, conservation, appliance efficiency and other technology.
[ results of operations]
Overall Operations
Overall earnings per share for 1995 were $1.41, compared to $1.28 in 1994 and $1.44 in 1993. The 1995 results
include improved earnings from the Company's electric operations and $6.1 million in transactional gains from Pentzer
Corporation (Pentzer), primarily due to the sale of stock in ITRON, Inc. (ITRON). The 1994 earnings include $8.0 million of gains
recorded by Pentzer primarily as a result of the sale of ITRON stock. The 1993 results include gains totaling $12.8 million
recorded by Pentzer as a result of the sale of several investments in its portfolio and the sale of stock in the initial public
offering by ITRON in November 1993.
Utility income available for common stock increased $8.3 million, or 15%, in 1995 after decreasing $6.3 million,
or 10%, in 1994. Utility income contributed $1.14 to earnings per share in 1995, compared to $1.03 in 1994 and $1.19
in 1993. Non-utility income available for common stock in-
creased $1.2 million in 1995 and $0.4 million in 1994 and
contributed $0.27 to earnings per share in 1995 and $0.25 in
1994 and 1993.
Kilowatt-Hour Sales (in Millions of Kilowatt-Hours)
● Retail ◆ Wholesale
Income from electric operations increased $17.2 million, or
18%, in 1995 over 1994, primarily due to increased wholesale
revenues, resulting from both new power contracts and improved
streamflow conditions, and decreased purchased power and fuel
expense, both a result of the improved streamflows. Income from
natural gas operations increased $0.2 million in 1995 over 1994.
During 1995, increased natural gas revenues, which were primarily
the result of customer growth, were nearly offset by increased
purchased gas costs and other operating expenses. Weather that
was 9% warmer than normal during 1994 reduced residential
usage for both electric and natural gas customers. Income from
electric operations increased $0.1 million in 1994 over 1993
primarily as a result of decreased purchased power expense.
Income from natural gas operations decreased $0.9 million in
1994, as compared to 1993, due primarily to increased purchased gas costs that were offset substantially by increased revenues
due to customer growth..

Interest expense increased $5.9 million in 1995, as compared to 1994, and $2.9 million in 1994, as compared to 1993, with
both increases primarily due to higher levels of outstanding debt and a shift from short-term debt to long-term debt and the
resulting higher interest rates. During 1995 and 1994, $ 78.0 million and $88.0 million, respectively, in long-term debt was
issued, while $45.0 million and $7.5 million, respectively, of long-term debt matured or was redeemed. At December 31,
1995, long-term debt outstanding was $17.1 million higher than at December 31, 1994. Long-term debt outstanding at December
31, 1994, was $73.9 million higher than at the end of 1993.
Other Income decreased in 1995 over 1994, primarily due to lower levels of Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
[AFUDC) and other capitalized interest, as a result of lower levels of construction and conservation program expenditures. (See Note
1 to Financial Statements for additional information about AFUDC:) Also contributing to the decline in Other Income were the
accrual for environmental remediation work (see Note 14 to Financial Statements for additional information) and amortization
of the acquisition adjustment from the Company's purchase of PacifiCorp's electric properties in northern Idaho in late
December 1994.

Revenues
Electric revenues increased in all classes for 1995, as compared to 1994. Wholesale revenues increased $17.8 million, or
30%, in 1995, primarily due to new power contracts for firm service and increased secondary sales, as a result of improved
streamflow conditions which led to increased availability of hydroelectric generation in the region, and generation from the
Rathdrum combustion turbine which went into service in January 1995. Residential and commercial revenues increased by
a combined $18.8 million, primarily as a result of an increase of nearly 16,500 customers, or 6%, during 1995. Approximately
10,000 residential and commercial customers were added through the acquisition of PacifiCorp's electric properties in northern
Idaho in late December 1994.
Electric revenues decreased by 3% in 1994, as compared to 1993, due to a combination of decreased residential and
Wholesale sales, partially offset by increased commercial sales and higher wheeling revenues. Wholesale revenues decreased
$17.2 million during 1994, compared to 1993, primarily due to a significant short-term sale of wholesale energy in
1993 which increased wholesale revenues in that period, low streamflow conditions during 1994 which led to decreased KWh
sales and lower wholesale prices. Residential revenues for 1994 decreased by $7.0 million from 1993, despite a 3% increase in
customers, due to warm weather throughout most of the year. Residential usage continues to be affected by new appliance
efficiency and other technology which has decreased customers' requirements over time. Commercial revenues increased $5.0
million, or 4%, in 1994, as compared to 1993, due to 3% customer growth and the slightly warmer-than-normal weather
which increased air conditioning load. Commercial customers tend to use air conditioning systems at much cooler temperatures
than residential customers, with the result that air conditioning load can be up within the commercial sector and not within
the residential sector, as during the fall of 1994.
Total natural gas revenues increased $17.5 million, or 11%, in 1995, which was the result of increased therm sales of 24%
In 1995. Residential and commercial revenues increased by a combined $9.5 million in 1995 as compared to 1994, primarily
as a result of 7% customer growth in those sectors, primarily due to conversions from electric service to natural gas, population
growth and new construction. During 1995, the Company sold natural gas on a non-retail sales basis, which accounted for
a $5.4 million increase in total revenues. The revenues from these sales were offset by like increases in purchased gas
expense. Margins from these transactions are credited back to customers through rate changes for the cost of gas. Transportation
sales increased by 13%, leading to a $1.2 million increase in revenues.
Total natural gas revenues increased in all customer classes except industrial in 1994 compared to 1993. In 1994, natural
gas revenues from residential and commercial customers rose by $8.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively. The increased
revenues were due to customer growth and higher average prices than in 1993, which were offset in part by lower usage per
customer as a result of warm temperatures. Much of the customer growth during the early part of 1994 was the result of the
Company's emphasis on conversions from electric service to natural gas. Revisions in the Company's Demand Side Management
programs in 1994 have lessened the pace of conversions. During 1994, the Company began selling natural gas on a non-retail
sales basis, which resulted in a $5.1 million increase in revenues and a like increase in purchased gas expense.
Operating Expenses
Improved streamflow conditions, which resulted in increased hydroelectric generation, caused purchased power expense
for 1995 to decline by $8.6 million from 1994. Hydroelectric generation was 105% above normal, due to streamflows which
were 120% of normal in 1995. Purchased power costs in 1994 decreased $12.5 million, or 11%, from levels incurred during
1993, primarily due to increased purchases during 1993 to complete a significant short-term sale of wholesale energy and to
replace lost thermal generation due to plant outages. Hydroelectric generation in 1994 was 23% below normal, caused by
streamflows which were 65% of normal.
Fuel costs decreased $6.9 million in 1995 compared to 1994 as a result of the increased availability of hydroelectric
generation. The decreased thermal plant fuel expense was partially offset by fuel expense for generation from the Rathdrum
combustion turbines, particularly in the last half of the year. Fuel costs increased $4.9 million in 1994 over 1993 due to
increased thermal generation as a result of the low streamflows in 1994 and shutdowns at thermal plants during 1993 which
decreased fuel expense for that year.
A large portion of purchased gas expense is variable costs, with the result that increases in revenues are generally offset
by like increases in purchased gas expense. Natural gas purchased expense increased $11.1 million, or 12%, in 1995 as
compared to 1994, primarily as the result of an increase in therm sales of 125.8 million, or 24%. Increases in therm sales were
primarily due to customer growth in all customer classes and non-retail sales. Natural gas purchased expense increased $19.4
million in 1994 from 1993, which was the result of increased therm sales of 32.1 million therms.

Other electric operating and maintenance expenses increased $19.6 million in 1995 primarily due to lease payments and
operating expenses related to the Rathdrum combustion turbine, increased amortization of conservation programs, a higher
accrual for uncollectible accounts, environmental remediation reserves (see Note 14 to Financial Statements for additional
information) and the Idaho Power Cost Adjustment (PCA), which allows the Company to change rates to recover or rebate a
portion of the difference between actual and allowed net power supply costs. Net PCA adjustments, resulting from improved
streamflow conditions, accounted for $5.8 million of the increase
in other operating and maintenance expenses in 1995 from 1994.
Net PCA adjustments, resulting from low hydroelectric conditions,
accounted for $4.1 million of the decrease in other operating and
maintenance expenses in 1994 from 1993. Transmission and
distribution costs decreased by a combined $3.3 million in 1994,
as a result of decreased wholesale KWh sales and the associated
wheeling costs, which also contributed to the decrease in other
operating and maintenance expenses from the 1993 levels.
Administrative and general expenses increased by $5.3
million in 1995, compared to 1994, primarily due to lease
payments for computer software systems, labor expenses resulting
from merger activities and other labor-related costs. Administrative
and general expenses increased by $3.7 million in 1994 over
1993, primarily due to labor-related cost increases.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.7
million in 1995, primarily due to increased plant-in-service,
particularly natural gas plant. During 1994, depreciation and

amortization expense increased $1.0 million due to increased electric plant.
Other taxes, primarily excise and business and occupational taxes, were up $1.3 million in 1995 over 1994 due to
increased revenues in 1995.
Income taxes increased by $9.9 million, or 26%, in 1995, as a result of increased income from electric operations. Electric
operations accounted for $8.7 million of the increase. Income tax expense decreased $3.2 million in 1994 as compared to 1993
primarily due to decreased income from electric operations.
[ non-utility operations]
Non-utility operations include the results of Pentzer and four other subsidiary companies. Pentzer's business strategy is
to acquire controlling interests in a broad range of middle-market companies, to help these companies grow through internal
development and strategic acquisitions and to sell the portfolio investments either to the public or to strategic buyers when
it becomes most advantageous in meeting Pentzer's return on invested capital objectives. Pentzer's goal is to produce financial
returns for the Company's shareholders that, over the long-term, should be higher than that of the utility operations. From time
to time, a significant portion of Pentzer's earnings contributions may be the result of transactional gains. Accordingly, although
the income stream is expected to be positive, it may be uneven from year to year.
Non-utility net income for 1995 was $14.8 million, which represents a 9% increase over 1994 earnings of $13.6 million.
The increase in 1995 earnings primarily resulted from a $2.2 million increase in non-transactional earnings over 1994 as a
result of improved earnings from companies in Pentzer's investment portfolio, including earnings from two companies newly
acquired in 1995. Non-utility operating revenues and expenses both increased substantially in 1995 as compared to 1994 as
a result of acquisitions over the past two years.
Non-utility net income for 1994 increased 3% over 1993 earnings. The increase in 1994 earnings primarily resulted
from improved earnings from companies in Pentzer's investment portfolio, including earnings from newly acquired companies.
Non-utility operating revenues and expenses both increased substantially in 1994 as compared to 1993 as a result of
acquisitions during both 1994 and 1993.
Transactional gains in 1995 declined by $1.1 million as compared to 1994. Transactional gains of $8.0 million in 1994
declined by $4.8 million as compared to 1993. The 1995 and 1994 transactional gains were primarily the result of gains
recorded from the sale of ITRON stock. The 1993 transactional gains included gains of $7.1 million from thè sale of companies
involved in telecommunications, technology and energy and a transactional gain of $5.7 million from the sale of ITRON stock.

]20I liquidity and capital resources]
Utility
The Company funds capital expenditures with a combination of internally-generated cash and external financing. The
level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates annually. Cash provided
by operating activities remains the Company's primary source of funds for operating needs, dividends and construction
expenditures.
Operating Activities - Cash from operating activities less cash dividends paid provided 83% of utility capital expendi-
tures in 1995 as compared to 66% in 1994 and 67% in 1993. Cash available from operating activities in 1995 declined from
1994 primarily due to increases in deferred taxes and various working capital components, such as receivables, materials and
supplies, fuel stock and natural gas stored and prepayments on power contracts, partially offset by the positive effect of purchased
gas deferrals. However, as discussed below, construction expenditures declined by 13% in 1995 from 1994 so that cash from
operating activities provided a higher percentage of the funds for construction than in the two previous years. See Note 1 to
Pinancial Statements for additional information.
Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities decreased in 1995 over 1994 primarily due to the acquisition of
the northern Idaho properties of PacifiCorp for $33 million in 1994 and a $22 million decrease in other capital requirements,
which included conservation-related capital expenditures. Utility capital expenditures, excluding Allowance for Funds Used
During Construction (AFUDC) and Allowance for Funds Used to Conserve Energy (APUCE, a carrying charge similar to AFUDC for
conservation-related capital expenditures], were $338 million for the 1993-1995 period.
Financing Activitles - During the 1993-1995 period, $95.0 million of long-term debt matured and $231.6 million of
higher-cost debt and preferred stock was redeemed and refinanced at lower cost. During 1995, $45 million of long-term debt,
with an average interest rate of 7.19%, matured and $78 million of First Mortgage Bonds issued in the form of Secured
Medium-Term Notes were issued at an average interest rate of 7.1% and an average maturity of 8 years.
Capital expenditures are financed on an interim basis with notes payable (due within one year). The Company has $160
million in committed lines of credit. In addition, the Company may borrow up to $60 million through other borrowing arrangements
with banks. As of December 31, 1995, $19.5 million was outstanding under the committed lines of credit and $10.0 million
was outstanding under other short-term borrowing arrangements.
From time to time the Company enters into sale/leaseback arrangements for various long-term assets which provide
additional sources of funds. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for additional information.
The Company is restricted under various agreements as to the additional securities it can issue. Under the most
restrictive test of the Company's Mortgage, an additional $524 million of First Mortgage Bonds could be issued as of December
31, 1995. As of December 31, 1995, under its Restated Articles of Incorporation, approximately $673 million of additional
preferred stock could be issued at an assumed dividend rate of 7.25%.
During the 1996-1998 period, utility capital expenditures are expected to be $237 million, and $90 million will be
required for long-term debt maturities and preferred stock sinking fund requirements. During this three-year period, the
Company estimates that internally-generated funds will average 95% of the funds needed for its capital expenditure program.
Minimal amounts of external financing will be required to fund maturing long-term debt, preferred stock sinking fund
requirements and the remaining portion of capital expenditures. These estimates of capital expenditures are subject to
continuing review and adjustments. Actual capital expenditures may vary from these estimates due to factors such as changes
in business conditions, construction schedules and environmental requirements. These projections relate to the Company on
a stand-alone basis and do not reflect any adjustment for the effects of the proposed merger of the Company, Sierra Pacific
Resources (SPR) and Sierra Pacific Power Company (SPPC) with and into Altus Corporation (Altus). See Future Outlook
Merger below.
See Notes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to Financial Statements for additional details related to financing activities.
Non-Utility
Capital expenditures for the non-utility operations were $13 million for the 1993-1995 period. During this period,
$9 million of debt was repaid and capital expenditures were partially financed by the $14 million in proceeds from new long-
term debt.
The non-utility operations have $48 million in short-term borrowing arrangements ($26.6 million outstanding as of
December 31, 1995) to fund corporate requirements on an interim basis. At December 31, 1995, the non-utility operations had
$32.2 million in cash and marketable securities with $28.5 million in long-term debt outstanding.
The 1996-1998 non-utility capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million, and $21 million in debt maturities will

The Company's total common equity increased by $40 million to $717 million at the end of 1995. The 1995 increase
was primarily due to the issuance of 1.5 million shares of common stock through both the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the
Investment and Employee Stock Ownership Plan for proceeds of $24.0 million and a $10.2 million increase in retained
earnings. The Company's consolidated capital structure at December 31, 1995, was 46% debt, 9% preferred stock and 45%

[future outlook ]
Merger
In June 1994, the Company, Sierra Pacific Resources (SPR), Sierra Pacific Power Company, a subsidiary of SPR (SPPC),
and Altus Corporation (Altus, formerly named Resources West Energy Corporation), a newly formed subsidiary of the Company,
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, as subsequently, amended (Merger Agreement), which
provides for the merger of the Company, SPR and SPPC into Altus.
SPR and SPPC are both Nevada corporations with headquarters in
Reno. The Merger Agreement provides that after the effective
date of the merger, Altus' corporate headquarters office and prin-
cipal executive offices will be located in Spokane and that the
headquarters of the Washington Water Power and Sierra Pacific
operating divisions will be in Spokane and Reno, respectively. As
a result of the Merger Agreement, holders of WWP Common Stock
would receive one share and holders of SPR Common Stock would
receive 1.44 shares of Altus Common Stock, respectively. Each
outstanding share of Preferred Stock of WWP and SPPC, respec-
tively, will be converted into the right to receive one share of
Altus Preferred Stock with equal stated value and dividends and
like redemption provisions and rights upon liquidation.
Approval of the proposed merger was obtained from WWP,
SPR and SPPC shareholders at meetings held on November 18,
1994. The Merger Agreement is also subject to certain customary
closing conditions, including without limitation, the receipt of all
necessary governmental approvals, including approval of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the state
utility commissions of California [CPUC), Idaho [IPUC), Montana (MPSC), Nevada (PSCN), Oregon (OPUC) and Washington (WUTC).
Applications were filed with each of the state commissions and the FERC in the third quarter of 1994.
The MPSC issued an order in October 1994 declining to exercise jurisdiction. The Company has received orders approv-
ing the merger from the commission of each state.

On October 17, 1995, the Commission stayed the effectiveness of the September 28, 1995 order, so as to allow its
staff and Public Counsel the opportunity to review and evaluate the order of the Nevada Commission; this stay
was subsequently lifted by order of the Commission dated December 5, 1995. The amended WUTC order states
that if the use of single-system pricing information by any other jurisdiction or the inter-divisional compensation
for use of transmission facilities affects allocation of revenues, expenses, rate base or cost of capital to the
detriment of Washington ratepayers, such effects will not be reflected in Washington results of operations for any
purpose. The amended WUTC order states that "shareholders are at risk for any differences if there are costs that
are made unrecoverable by this prohibition."

Company and SPR filed a petition with the PSCN requesting clarification of their order. The companies sought
clarification on two key issues within the PSCN's order. The two issues were electric single-system pricing for
retail services and the distribution of benefits related to the Alturas transmission project. On November 20, 1995,
the PSCN issued an order denying the petition for clarification.
On November 29, 1995, the PERC ordered evidentiary hearings concerning the proposed merger. Issues raised by the
FERC primarily revolve around single-system versus zonal transmission rates, pricing for inter-divisional energy transfers,
justification of cost savings and the effects on competition, including access by third-party users to the merged company's
transmission system, the resolution of which could have an impact on the level of anticipated savings. (See Competition and
Business Risk below for additional information on the issuance of the FERC's policy statement in the forthcoming rulemaking
"on transmission access and pricing.) An administrative law judge has been assigned to the merger proceeding and a pre-
hearing conference was held on December 13, 1995 to set a procedural schedule. The companies filed supplemental testimony
on February 1, 1996. Hearings are scheduled to begin on June 4, 1996. Based on this schedule, the companies believe an order
could be issued by the FERC in 1996 or early 1997.

Washington Water Power▸ If closing conditions contained in the Merger Agreement are not satisfied or in the event that the merger is not closed
on or before June 27, 1996 and either of the parties exercises its right of termination any time thereafter as provided in the
Agreement, the Company would continue to operate as a separate utility and expense the merger costs that were incurred.
See Note 16 to Financial Statements for additional information.
Competition and Business Risk
The electric and natural gas utility businesses continue to undergo numerous transformations and are becoming
increasingly competitive as a result of economic, regulatory and technological changes. The Company believes that it is well
positioned to meet future challenges due to its low production costs, close proximity to major transmission lines and natural
gas pipelines, active participation in the wholesale electric market and its commitment to high levels of customer satisfaction,
cost reduction and continuous improvement of work processes. Additionally, the Company continually evaluates merger and
acquisition opportunities that will allow it to expand its economies of scale and diversify its risk posed by weather and
economic conditions.
The Company continues to compete for new retail electric customers with various rural electric cooperatives and public
utility districts in and adjacent to its service territories. Challenges facing the electric business include the potential for retail
wheeling, the costs of increasingly stringent environmental laws and the potential for stranded or nonrecoverable utility
assets. Challenges facing the electric retail business include evolving technologies which provide alternate energy supplies,
reduced energy consumption and the cost of the energy supplied, self-generation and fuel switching by commercial and
industrial customers. If electric utility companies are eventually required to provide retail wheeling service, which is the
transmission of electric power from another supplier to a customer located within such utility's service area, the Company
believes it will be in a position to benefit since it is committed to
remaining one of the country's lowest-cost providers of electric
energy. Consequently, the Company believes it faces minimal
risk for stranded generation, transmission or distribution assets
due to its low cost structure.

On March 29, 1995, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (NOPR) relating to transmission services and a supple-
mental NOPR on Recovery of Stranded Costs. If adopted, the NOPR
on open access transmission would require public utilities oper-
ating under the Federal Power Act to provide third-party access
to their transmission systems. Each utility would also be required
to establish separate rates for its transmission and generation
services for new wholesale service. Further, utilities would be required to take transmission service under the same tariffs
applicable to third-party users. The FERC requested comments on the desirability of unified standards for both wholesale and
retail transmission services. The FERC suggested, as a possible approach, the establishment by each vertically integrated
electric utility of a distribution function which would be treated as a wholesale customer taking transmission services under
the utility's filed wholesale transmission tariff. The FERC recognized, and numerous comments confirmed, that such an
approach would change the traditional approach of state-federal allocation of transmission costs. The supplemental NOPR on
stranded costs provides a basis for recovery by regulated public utilities of legitimate and verifiable stranded costs associated
with existing wholesale requirements customers and retail customers who become unbundled wholesale transmission custom-
ers of the utility. The FERC will consider allowing recovery of stranded investment costs associated with retail wheeling only
if a state regulatory commission lacks the authority to consider that issue. It is anticipated that the final rules could take effect
in the first half of 1996.
93
1,590
94
The National Energy Policy Act (NEPA) enacted in 1992
addresses a wide range of issues affecting the wholesale electric
business. The Company believes NEPA provides future transmis-
sion, energy production and sales opportunities to the Company
and complements the Company's commitment to the wholesale
electric business.
95
The Company does not believe that the Open Access NOPR will have a material effect on the Company's results of
operations, assuming that the final rule is adopted substantially as proposed. However, if, in the pending or a subsequent rule-
making proceeding, the PERC adopted a rule which had the effect of requiring the wholesale transmission rate to be
recognized as the transmission component of retail rates, and if the FERC imposed single-system transmission rates on Altus
in the Merger proceeding, this could lead to a reduction of Altus' retail rates in Nevada but would not necessarily result in a
corresponding increase in Washington and Idaho.
The Company continues to compete in the wholesale electric market with other western utilities, federal marketing
agencies and power marketers. Business challenges affecting the wholesale electric business include new entrants in the
1] 24
Washington Water Powerwholesale market, such as power brokers and marketers, competition from low-cost generation being developed by indepen-
dent power producers and declining margins.
Natural gas remains priced competitively compared to other alternative fuel sources for residential, commercial and
industrial customers and is projected to remain so well into the future due to increasing supplies and competition. Challenges
facing the Company's natural gas business include the potential for customers to by-pass the Company's natural gas system.
Since 1988, two of the Company's large industrial customers have built their own pipeline interconnection. However, these
customers continue to purchase natural gas services from the Company. To reduce the potential for such by-pass, the Company
prices its natural gas services, including transportation contracts, competitively and has varying degrees of flexibility to price
its transportation and delivery rates by means of special contracts. The Company has also signed long-term transportation
contracts with two of its largest industrial customers which minimizes the risks of these customers by-passing the Company's
system in the foreseeable future.
Resource planning for both the electric and natural gas businesses has been integrated so that the Company's customers
are provided the most efficient and cost-effective products possible for all their energy requirements. The Company's need
for future electric resources to serve retail loads is expected to remain very minimal. The switching of electric heating
customers to natural gas requires increased efforts on the Company's part in negotiating and securing competitively-priced
natural gas supplies for the future.
Economic and Load Growth
The Company expects economic growth to increase in its eastern Washington and northern Idaho service area. The
Company, along with others in the service area, continues its efforts to expand existing businesses and attract new businesses
to the Inland Northwest. In the past, agriculture, mining and lumber have been the primary industries. However, health care,
electronic and other manufacturing, tourism and the service sectors have become increasingly important industries that
operate in the Company's service area. In addition, the Company also anticipates strong economic growth to continue in its
Oregon service area.
The Company anticipates electric retail load growth to average approximately 1.4% annually for the next five years
primarily due to increases in both population and the number of businesses in its service territory. Although the number of
electric customers is expected to increase, the average annual usage by residential customers is expected to remain stable on
a weather-adjusted basis.
The Company anticipates natural gas load growth, including transportation volumes, in its Washington and Idaho
service area to average approximately 3.1% annually for the next five years. The Oregon and South Lake Tahoe, California
service areas are anticipated to realize 3.2% growth annually during that same period.
The forward-looking projections set forth above regarding retail sales growth are based, in part, upon publicly available
population and demographic studies conducted independently. The Company's expectations regarding retail sales growth are
also based upon various assumptions including, without limitation, assumptions relating to weather and economic and
competitive conditions and an assumption that the Company will incur no 'material loss of retail customers due to self-
generation or retail wheeling. Changes in the underlying assumptions can cause actual experience to vary significantly from
forward-looking projections.
Environmental Issues
Since December 1991, a number of species of fish in the Northwest, including the Snake River sockeye salmon and
chinook salmon, the Kootenai River white sturgeon and the bull trout have either been added to the endangered species list
under the Federal Endangered Species Act (ESA), listed as "threatened" under the ESA or been petitioned for listing under the
ESA. Thus far, measures which have been adopted and implemented to save both the Snake River sockeye salmon and chinook
salmon have not directly impacted generation levels at any of the Company's hydroelectric dams. The Company does,
however, purchase power from four projects on the Columbia River that are being directly impacted by these ongoing
mitigation measures. The reduction in generation at these projects is relatively minor, resulting in minimal economic impact
on the Company at this time. Future actions to save these, and other as yet unidentified fish or wildlife species, could further
impact the Company's operations or the operations of some of its major customers. However, it is currently impossible to
predict likely economic costs to the Company resulting from these actions.
See Note 14 to Financial Statements for additional information.

The Board of Directors considers the level of dividends on the Company's common stock on a continuing basis, taking
into account numerous factors including, without limitation, the Company's results of operations and financial condition, as
well as general economic and competitive conditions. The Company's net income available for dividends are derived from its
retail electric and natural gas utility operations and, increasingly, from its growing wholesale electric operations and Pentzer's
non-utility investment operations.
Washington Water Power 25[ management's statement of responsibility]
Management of The Washington Water Power Company is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the
information in this annual report. The financial and operating information is derived from company records, and includes
amounts based on judgment and estimates where necessary. Quality control practices for reporting business information in
combination with the company's internal control procedures provide adequate assurance that the annual report fairly and
reasonably presents the company's financial position and operating results.
The board of directors appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent accounting firm, to audit the financial statements.
Deloitte & Touche LLP was provided access to all information and documentation necessary for the audit. In the course of their
work, the independent auditors and internal auditors may recommend changes in control procedures. Management takes
appropriate action based on such recommendations.

[audit committee report]
The board of directors exercises certain oversight functions through the audit committee. The audit committee is not
involved in day-to-day company management. Directors Eugene Meyer, Jean Silver and John Taylor served on the audit
committee for all of 1995 and retired Director Eugene Thompson served for part of the year.
The audit committee met once each quarter in 1995. The committee met with the internal and external auditors, legal
counsel and selected management to obtain information about the company.
The audit committee's oversight function is in three areas:
Financial Reporting - The committee reviews quarterly and annual financial reports and other disclosures
to assure they reasonably portray the company's financial condition and results of operations, as well as to assure that
accounting policies are fair and consistent.
Corporate Governance - The committee monitors actions that assure reasonable steps are taken to comply with
pertinent laws, regulations and ethical business practices.
Corporate Control - The committee consults with the company's internal auditors and the independent auditors to
assure that management has established adequate and effective internal control systems.
The audit committee recommended to the board of directors that Deloitte & Touche LLP be appointed as the company's
independent auditors. The committee reviewed audit plans and received reports from the auditors, including certain meetings
without company management present.

[note 1] summary of significant accounting policies
Nature of Operations - The Company was incorporated in the State of Washington in 1889, and is primarily engaged
as a utility in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy and the purchase, transportation,
distribution and sale of natural gas. Natural gas operations are affected to a significant degree by weather conditions and
customer growth. The Company's electric operations are highly dependent upon hydroelectric generation for its power supply.
As a result, the electric operations of the Company are significantly affected by weather and streamflow conditions and, to a
lesser degree, by customer growth. Revenues from new wholesale contracts and the sale of surplus energy to other utilities
and the cost of power purchases vary from year to year depending on streamflow conditions and the wholesale power market.
The wholesale power market in the Northwest region is affected by several factors, including the availability of water for
hydroelectric generation, the availability of base load plants in the region and the demand for power in the Southwest region.
Other factors affecting the wholesale power market include new entrants in the wholesale market, such as power brokers and
marketers, and competition from low cost generation being developed by independent power producers. Usage by retail
customers varies from year to year primarily as a result of weather conditions, the economy in the Company's service area,
customer growth, conservation, appliance efficiency and other technology.
Basis of Reporting - The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and, as such, include the assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses of The Washington Water Power Company (Company) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Pentzer Corporation (Pentzer), Washington Irrigation and Development Company (WIDCO), Altus Laboratories, Altus Energy
Solutions and WP Finance Company. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the consolidation. As
discussed in Note 15, the 1993 and 1994 operating results for ITRON were accounted for on the equity method; however, as
of December 31, 1994, Pentzer's investment in ITRON is classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accompanying financial statements include the Company's proportionate share of utility
plant and related operations resulting from its interests in jointly owned plants (See Note 3). The financial activity of each of
the Company's segments is reported in the "Schedule of Information by Business Segments." Such information is an integral
part of these financial statements.
The preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
System of Accounts The accounting records of the Company's utility operations are maintained in accordance with
the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (PERC) and adopted by the appro-
priate state regulatory commissions.
Regulation - The Company is subject to state regulation in Washington, Idaho and Montana for its electric operations.
Natural gas operations are regulated in Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California. The Company is subject to regulation by the
FERC with respect to its wholesale electric transmission rates and the natural gas rates charged for the release of capacity from
the Jackson Prairie Storage Project.
Operating Revenues - The Company accrues estimated unbilled revenues for electric and natural gas services provided
through month-end.
Other Income net - Other income-net is composed of the following items:
.

Interest income

Earnings Per Share Earnings per share have been computed based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period.
"
Utility Plant The cost of additions to utility plant, including an allowance for funds used during construction and
replacements of units of property and betterments, is capitalized. Costs of depreciable units of property retired plus costs of
removal less salvage are charged to accumulated depreciation.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction - The Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) represents
the cost of both the debt and equity funds used to finance utility plant additions during the construction period. In accordance with
the uniform system of accounts prescribed by regulatory authorities, AFUDC is capitalized as a part of the cost of utility plantand is credited currently as a noncash item to Other Income (see Other Income above). The Company generally is permitted,
under established regulatory rate practices, to recover the capitalized AFUDC, and a fair return thereon, through its inclusion
in rate base and the provision for depreciation after the related utility plant has been placed in service. Cash inflow related
to AFUDC does not occur until the related utility plant has been placed in service..
The effective AFUDC rate was 10.67% in 1995, 1994 and 1993. The Company's AFUDC rates do not exceed the maximum
allowable rates as determined in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.
Depreciation For utility operations, depreciation provisions are estimated by a method of depreciation accounting
utilizing unit rates for hydroelectric plants and composite rates for other properties. Such rates are designed to provide for
retirements of properties at the expiration of their service lives. The rates for hydroelectric plants include annuity and interest
components, in which the interest component is 6%. For utility operations, the ratio of depreciation provisions to average
depreciable property was 2.57% in 1995, 2.56% in 1994 and 2.68% in 1993.
Cash and Cash Equivalents - For the purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers
all temporary investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Temporary Investments Under FAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,"
investments in debt and marketable equity securities are classified as "available for sale" and are recorded at fair value.
Investments totaling $37.1 million and $27.4 million are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1995 as
other property and investments and current assets, respectively. Investments totaling $34.1 million and $27.9 million are
included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 1994 as other property and investments and current assets,
respectively. Unrealized investment gains, as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, of $19.2 million and $14.3 million, respectively,
net of taxes, are reflected as a separate component of shareholders' equity on the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Company has used derivative instruments to a limited extent as a means of
hedging its costs and preserving margins in the wholesale power business. The extent of derivatives used through the end of
1995 is not significant. The Company may continue to use derivative instruments for hedging and risk mitigation purposes, but
has adopted a policy not to trade in derivatives for speculative reasons.
Deferred Charges and Credits The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of
FAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation." A regulated enterprise can prepare its financial
statements in accordance with FAS No. 71 only if (i) the enterprise's rates for regulated services are established by or subject
to approval by an independent third-party regulator, (ii) the regulated rates are designed to recover the enterprise's cost of
providing the regulated services and (iii) in view of demand for the regulated services and the level of competition, it is
reasonable to assume that rates set at levels that will recover the enterprise's costs can be charged to and collected from
customers. FAS No. 71 requires a cost-based, rate-regulated enterprise to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its
financial statements. In certain circumstances, FAS No. 71 requires that certain costs and/or obligations (such as incurred costs
not currently recovered through rates, but expected to be so recovered in the future) be reflected in a deferral account in the
balance sheet and not be reflected in the statement of income or loss until matching revenues are recognized. If at some point
in the future the Company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of FAS No. 71 to all or a
portion of the Company's regulated operations, the Company would be required to write off its regulatory assets and would be
precluded from the future deferral in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of costs not recovered through rates at the time such costs
were incurred, even if such costs were expected to be recovered in the future.
-
The Company's primary regulatory assets include Investment in Exchange Power, conservation programs, deferred
income taxes, the provision for postretirement benefits, unrecovered purchased gas costs and debt issuance and redemption
costs. Included in Deferred Charges, Other are merger transaction and transition costs. Deferred credits include the gain on the
general office building sale/leaseback being amortized over the life of the lease.
Power and Natural Gas Cost Adjustment Provisions - In 1989, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (IPUC) approved the
Company's filing for a power cost adjustment mechanism (PCA). The PCA is designed to allow the Company to modify electric
rates to recover or rebate a portion of the difference between actual and allowed net power supply costs. On July 18, 1994,
the IPUC approved an indefinite extension of the Company's proposed modifications to the PCA. The modified PCA tracks
changes in hydroelectric generation, secondary prices, related changes in thermal generation and PURPA contracts, but it no
longer tracks changes in revenues or cost associated with other wheeling or power contracts. Rate changes are triggered when
the deferred balance reaches $2.2 million. As of December 31, 1995, $0.7 million of credits not yet subject to a rebate had
accumulated in the PCA deferral account. The following surcharges were in effect during the past three years:
$2.3 million (2.4%) surcharge effective September 1, 1995, which will expire August 31, 1996
$2.2 million (2.5%) surcharge effective January 1, 1995, which expired December 31, 1995
$2.3 million [2.6%) surcharge effective November 1, 1992, which expired October 31, 1993
Washington Water Power 33
r] 33Under established regulatory practices, the Company is also allowed to adjust its natural gas rates from time to time to
reflect increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas purchased. Differences between actual natural gas costs and the natural
gas costs allowed in rates are deferred and charged or credited to expense when regulators approve inclusion of the cost
changes in rates.
Income Taxes The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file consolidated federal income tax returns. Subsidiaries are
charged or credited with the tax effects of their operations on a stand-alone basis. The Company's federal income tax returns
have been examined with all issues resolved, and all payments made, through the 1992 return.
New Accounting Standards - FAS No. 121, entitled "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995. FAS No. 121 requires the review of certain assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an asset is determined to
be impaired, a loss is recognized. The Company will adopt the standard on January 1, 1996, but does not expect any material
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. The Company will continue to periodically review its assets
to determine whether any assets meet the requirements for impairment recognition under this standard.
FAS No. 123, entitled "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1995, addresses the recommended accounting and disclosure for stock-based employee compensation plans.
The Company will adopt the standard on January 1, 1996, but will continue to measure stock-based compensation according
to Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) 25.
Reclassifications - Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current statement format. These
rted net income or common
reclassifications were made for comparative purposes and have not affected previously
shareholders' equity.

The Company has entered into an agreement whereby it can sell without recourse, on a revolving basis, up to $40,000,000
of interests in certain accounts receivable, both billed and unbilled. The Company is obligated to pay fees which approximate
the purchaser's cost of issuing commercial paper equal in value to the interests in receivables sold. The amount of such fees
is included in operating expenses. At both December 31, 1995 and 1994, $40,000,000 in receivables had been sold pursuant
to the agreement.
I note 5] common stock
In April 1990, the Company sold 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to the Trustee of the Investment and Employee
Stock Ownership Plan for Employees of the Company (Plan) for the benefit of the participants and beneficiaries of the Plan. In
payment for the shares of Common Stock, the Trustee issued a promissory note payable to the Company in the amount of
$14,125,000. Dividends paid on the stock held by the Trustee, plus Company contributions to the Plan, if any, are used by the
Trustee to make interest and principal payments on the promissory note. The balance of the promissory note receivable from
the Trustee ($11,690,250 at December 31, 1995) is reflected as a reduction to common equity. The shares of Common Stock
are allocated to the accounts of participants in the Plan as the note is repaid. During 1995, the cost recorded for the Plan was
$2,857,000. This included the cost for an additional 304,353 shares which were issued for ongoing employee and Company
contributions to the Plan. Interest on the note payable to the Company, cash and stock contributions to the Plan and dividends
on the shares held by the Trustee were $1,146,000, $2,350,000 and $1,215,000, respectively.
In February 1990, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan, which was subsequently amended, pursuant to
which holders of Common Stock outstanding on March 2, 1990, or issued thereafter, have been granted one preferred share
purchase right (Right) on each outstanding share of Common Stock. Each Right, initially evidenced by and traded with the
shares of Common Stock, entitles the registered holder to purchase one two-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock of the
Company, without par value, at an exercise price of $40, subject to certain adjustments, regulatory approval and other specified
conditions. The Rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 10% or more of the Common Stock or announces
a tender offer, the consummation of which would result in the beneficial ownership by a person or group of 10% or more of
the Common Stock. The Rights may be redeemed, at a redemption price of $0.005 per Right, by the Board of Directors of the
Company at any time until any person or group has acquired 10% or more of the Common Stock. The Rights will expire on the
earlier of February 16, 2000 or the effective time of the merger with Sierra Pacific Resources (SPR), Sierra Pacific Power
Company (SPPC) and Altus Corporation (Altus). See Note 16 for additional information about the proposed merger.
During 1992, the Company received authorization to issue 1.5 million shares of Common Stock under a second Periodic
Offering Program (POP). In 1993, 576,400 shares of the POP were issued for net proceeds of $11.2 million. Through December
31, 1993, 927,600 shares of the POP were issued for net proceeds of $17.3 million. No shares were issued under the POP
during 1994 or 1995. At December 31, 1995, 572,400 shares remained authorized but unissued.
The Company has a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan under which the Company's stockholders may auto-
matically reinvest their dividends and make optional cash payments for the purchase of the Company's Common Stock at current
market value.

At December 31, 1995, the Company maintained total lines of credit with various banks under two separate credit
agreements amounting to $160,000,000. The Company has one revolving line of credit, expiring December 9, 1997, which
provides a total credit commitment of $70,000,000. The second revolving credit agreement is composed of two tranches
totaling $90,000,000. One tranche provides for up to $50,000,000 of notes to be outstanding at any one time, while the
other provides for up to $40,000,000 of notes to be outstanding at any one time. Both tranches of this agreement expire
on July 24, 1996. The Company pays commitment fees of up to 0.15% per annum on the average daily unused portion of each
credit agreement.
In addition, under various agreements with banks, the Company can have up to $60,000,000 in loans outstanding at
any one time, with the loans available at the banks' discretion. These arrangements provide, if funds are made available,
for fixed-term loans for up to 180 days at a fixed rate of interest. In December 1994, the Company terminated its commercial

[note 9] leases
The Company has entered into several lease arrangements involving various assets, with minimum terms ranging from
eleven months to seventeen years and expiration dates from 1995 to 2011. Certain of the lease arrangements require the
Company, upon the occurrence of specified events, to purchase the leased assets for varying amounts over the term of the
lease. The Company's management believes that the likelihood of the occurrence of the specified events under which the
Company could be required to purchase the property is remote. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994
and 1993 was $10.7 million, $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively. Future minimum lease payments (in thousands of
dollars] required under operating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
December 31, 1995 are estimated as follows:

$47,275[note 10] pension plans
The Company has a pension plan covering substantially all of its regular full-time employees. Certain of the Company's
subsidiaries also participate in this plan. Individual benefits under this plan are based upon years of service and the employee's
average compensation as specified in the Plan. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount equal to the
net periodic pension cost, provided that such contributions are not less than the minimum amounts required to be funded under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, nor more than the maximum amounts which are currently deductible for tax
purposes. Pension fund assets are invested primarily in marketable debt and equity securities. The Company also has another
plan which covers the executive officers.
Net pension cost (income) for 1995, 1994 and 1993 is summarized as follows:
(Thousands of Dollars)
Service cost-benefits earned during the period
Interest cost on projected benefit obligation
Actual return on plan assets
Net amortization and deferral
Net periodic pension cost (income)

$(114,964,000), $188,596,000) and $184,531,000), respectively)
Projected benefit obligation for service rendered to date
Plan assets at fair value
The funded status of the Plans and the pension liability at December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, are as follows:

[ note 11] other postretirement benefits
7
FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," requires the Company to accrue
the estimated cost of postretirement benefit payments during the years that employees provide services and allows recognition
of the unrecognized transition obligation in the year of adoption or the amortization of such obligation over a period of up to
twenty years. The Company elected to amortize this obligation of approximately $34,500,000 over a period of twenty years
beginning in 1993.
The Company has received accounting orders from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) and
the IPUC allowing the current deferral of expense accruals under this Statement as a regulatory asset for future recovery. At
such time that rate recovery is requested and allowed, cumulative deferrals will be amortized over the remainder of the
twenty-year amortization period. The Company expects to be able to recover the amortized amounts. Therefore, the Company's
cash flows and income from operations were not affected by implementation of this Statement through 1995. The Company
will begin recognition of the expense accruals in 1996.
The Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its retired employees. In 1995,
1994 and 1993, the Company recognized $1,800,000, $1,270,000 and $1,250,000, respectively, as an expense for post-
retirement health care and life insurance benefits. The following table sets forth the health care plan's funded status at

The currently assumed health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
is 8.0% for 1995, decreasing linearly each successive year until it reaches 5.0% in 1999. The assumed rate of future medical
cost increases has been gradually decreased since the adoption of FAS 106 in response to the actual leveling off of cost
increases in the plan. A one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1995 and net postretirement health care cost by
approximately $2,299,000. The assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation
was 7.5%.
[note 12] accounting for income taxes
As of December 31, 1995 and 1994, the Company had recorded net regulatory assets of $169,432,000 and $174,349,000,
respectively, related to the probable recovery of FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," deferred tax liabilities from
customers through future rates. Such net regulatory assets will be adjusted by amounts recovered through rates.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of (a) temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and (b) tax credit carryforwards. The
net deferred federal income tax liability consists of the following:

[note 13] long-term purchased power contracts with required minimum payments
Under fixed contracts with Public Utility Districts (PUD), the Company has agreed to purchase portions of the output of
certain generating facilities. Although the Company has no investment in such facilities, these contracts provide that the
Company pay certain minimum amounts (which are based at least in part on the debt service requirements of the supplier)
whether or not the facility is operating. The cost of power obtained under the contracts, including payments made when a
facility is not operating, is included in operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Information as of December 31, 1995, pertaining to these contracts is summarized in the following table:

[note 14] commitments and contingencies
Nez Perce Tribe - On December 6, 1991, the Nez Perce Tribe filed an action against the Company in U. S. District Court
for the District of Idaho alleging, among other things, that two dams formerly operated by the Company, the Lewiston Dam on
the Clearwater River and the Grangeville Dam on the South Fork of the Clearwater River, provided inadequate passage tomigrating anadromous fish in violation of rights under treaties between the Tribe and the United States made in 1855 and
1863. The Lewiston and Grangeville Dams, which had been owned and operated by other utilities under hydroelectric licenses
from the Federal Power Commission (the "FPC", predecessor of the FERC) prior to acquisition by the Company, were acquired
by the Company in 1937 with the approval of the FPC, but were dismantled and removed in 1973 and 1963, respectively. The
Tribe initially indicated through expert opinion disclosures that they were seeking actual and punitive damages of $208
million. However, supplemental disclosures reflect allegations of actual loss under different assumptions of between $425
million and $650 million.
Discovery had been stayed pending a decision by the Court on a case involving some similar issues brought by the Tribe
against Idaho Power Company. The Court has since decided these issues and has dismissed all claims against Idaho Power.
The Idaho Power case has now been appealed by the Nez Perce Tribe to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On November 21,
1994, the Company filed its Motion and Brief in Support of Summary Judgment of Dismissal. The Nez Perce Tribe has filed a
reply brief, and has requested oral argument. A hearing on the Company's Motion for Summary Judgment was held by the Court
on July 27, 1995. On September 22, 1995, the federal magistrate issued a written opinion recommending to the District Court
that the Company's Motion for Summary Judgment be granted and the Tribe's claims dismissed. The matter is still pending
before the District Court. The case has not yet been set for trial. The Company is presently unable to assess the likelihood of
an adverse outcome in this litigation, or estimate an amount or range of potential loss in the event of an adverse outcome.
Oil Spill The Company completed an updated investigation of an oil spill from an underground storage tank that
occurred several years ago in downtown Spokane at the site of the Company's steam heat plant. The Company purchased the
plant in 1916 and operated it as a non-regulated plant until it was deactivated in 1986 in a business decision unrelated to
the spill. After the Bunker C fuel oil spill, initial studies suggested that the oil was being adequately contained by both
geological features and man-made structures. The Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) concurred with these
findings. However, more recent tests showed that the oil has migrated approximately one city block beyond the steam plant
property. On December 6, 1993, the Company asked the DOE to enter into negotiations for a Consent Decree which provided
for additional remedial investigation and a feasibility study. The Consent Decree, entered on November 8, 1994, provided for
22 additional soil borings to be made around the site, which have been completed. It is anticipated that a clean-up action plan
will be approved by the first quarter of 1996 and that the oil spill clean-up will be conducted in 1996. As of December 31,
1995, an accrual of $3.1 million is reflected on the Company's financial statements, which represents the Company's best
estimate of its liability.
The Company has completed a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) report, which has been submitted to the DOE.
The RI/FS report is subject to public review and comment. The report includes a recommended clean-up action plan (RCAP).
On August 17, 1995, a lawsuit was filed against the Company in Superior Court of the State of Washington for Spokane
County by Davenport Sun International Hotels and Properties, Inc., the owner of a hotel property in downtown Spokane,
Washington. The Complaint alleges that the oil released from the Company's Central Steamplant trespassed on property
owned by the plaintiff. In addition, the plaintiff claims that the Steamplant has caused a diminution of value of plaintiff's land.
"Generally, the Complaint is based on a claim of negligence, trespass and nuisance. Discovery has been initiated by the
Company and is in the initial stages. The matter has not been set for trial. The Company is presently unable to assess
the likelihood of an adverse outcome in this litigation, or estimate an amount or range of potential loss in the event of an
adverse outcome.
Firestorm On October 16, 1991, gale-force winds struck a five-county area in eastern Washington and a seven-county
area in northern Idaho. These winds were responsible for causing 92 separate wildland fires, resulting in two deaths and the
loss of 114 homes and other structures, some of which were located in the Company's service territory, Four separate class
action lawsuits were filed against the Company by private individuals in the Superior Court of Spokane County on October 13,
1993. These suits concern fires identified as Midway, Golden Cirrus, Nine Mile and Chattaroy. All of these suits were certified
as class actions on September 16, 1994, and bifurcated for trial of liability and damage issues by order of the same date.
The Company's Motion for Reconsideration was denied on October 21, 1994, and a Motion for Discretionary Review of the
Court's decision on certification of class actions was timely filed with the Washington Court of Appeals (Division III) on
November 14, 1994.
The Company was also served with two suits in Spokane County Superior Court filed on April 20, 1994 and on
September 15, 1994, both of which sought individual damages from separate fires within the Chattaroy fire complex. Five
additional and separate suits were brought by Grange Insurance Company, and were filed in Spokane County Superior Court
on October 10, 1994, for approximately $2.2 million paid to Grange insureds for the same fire areas. Two additional class
action suits were also filed - one in Lincoln County Superior Court, filed on October 14, 1994, for a fire known as "Nine Mile
West" (previously included in the Spokane County Nine Mile suit certified as a class action), and the second in Spokane County
Superior Court, filed on October 14, 1994, for the Ponderosa fire area (which had not been the subject of previous suit). The
Lincoln County suit has been transferred to Spokane County and both suits have now also been certified as class actions.
Complainants in all cases allege various theories of tortious conduct, including negligence, creation of a public nuisance,
strict liability and trespass; in most cases, complainants allege that fires were caused by electric distribution and/or trans-
mission lines downed by wind-downed trees. The lawsuits seek recovery for property damage, emotional and mental distress,
lost income and punitive damages, but do not specify the amount of damages being sought. Discovery is ongoing and the
Washington Water Power 41
r]45Company is presently unable to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or estimate an amount or range of potential loss
in the event of an adverse outcome. Trials are scheduled to commence on various dates between February 3, 1997 and
November 2, 1998. The Company was previously presented with a claim from the Washington State Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) for fire suppression costs associated with five of these fires in eastern Washington. The total of the DNR claim
was $1.0 million. On July 22, 1993, the Company entered into a settlement with the DNR whereby the Company agreed to pay
$200,000 to DNR in full settlement of any and all DNR claims; however, there was no admission of liability on the part of
the Company.
Williams Lake Lawsuit - On December 21, 1995, a lawsuit was commenced in Vancouver, British Columbia against the
Company's subsidiary, Pentzer, by Tondu Energy Systems, Inc. and T.E.S. Williams Lake Partnership alleging contract viola-
tions, conspiracy, misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duties in regard to the 1993 sale of assets of Pentzer Energy
Services, Inc. to B.C. Gas, Inc. and a U.S. subsidiary of B.C. Gas. The claims involve an alleged first right to purchase interests
in the Williams Lake, British Columbia wood-fired generating station. The suit seeks damages in excess of $10 million, plus
exemplary damages, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. Also named as defendants are B.C. Gas, Inc., Inland Pacific
Energy (Williams Lake) Corp., Pentzer Energy Services, Inc. and WP Energy Company. This action originally had been filed in
Spokane Superior Court against each of the same defendants and Washington Water Power. By order dated June 6, 1995, all
claims against Washington Water Power were dismissed by that court with prejudice and the claims against the remaining
defendants were dismissed without prejudice on the grounds that the lawsuit should have been brought in British Columbia.
The Company is presently unable to assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome or estimate an amount or range of potential
loss in the event of an adverse outcome.
Other Contingencies - The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews,
its contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges
and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and recoveries
from insurance carriers. The Company's policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures
related to environmental remediation sites based on estimates of investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred.
The Company has long-term contracts related to the purchase of fuel for thermal generation, natural gas and hydroelec-
tric power. Terms of the natural gas purchase contracts range from one month to five years and the majority provide for
minimum purchases at the then effective market rate. The Company also has various agreements for the purchase, sale or
exchange of electric energy with other utilities, cogenerators, small power producers and government agencies.
As of December 31, 1995, the Company's collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers represented approximately 47% of employees. The current agreement with the union local representing the
majority of the bargaining unit employees expires on March 25, 1997. A local agreement in the South Lake Tahoe area, which
represents approximately 7 employees, expires on June 30, 1996.
[note 15] acquisitions and dispositions
During 1995, Pentzer acquired two.companies, one that designs and packages point-of-purchase displays and other
marketing materials for national manufacturers of consumer products and the other that manufactures and assembles metal
and wood products for the computer, video arcade and point-of-purchase industries. In 1994 and 1993, Pentzer acquired two
and three companies, respectively. Sales of Pentzer's interest in companies involved in telecommunications, technology and
energy services resulted in transactional gains of $7.1 million in 1993.
In 1992, Pentzer's common stock ownership in ITRON was reduced from approximately 60% to approximately 40% as
a result of the issuance of common stock by ITRON in an acquisition. Accordingly, beginning in 1992, Pentzer's share of ITRON's
earnings was accounted for by the equity method and was included in Other Income-Net and its investment in ITRON was
reflected on the balance sheet under Other Property and Investments. ITRON's initial public offering in November 1993 and Pentzer's
sales of ITRON stock during 1993 and 1994 resulted in a reduction in Pentzer's ownership interest to approximately 14%. As a result,
Pentzer's investment in ITRON, beginning in December 1994, is classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
On March 1, 1996, a subsidiary of Pentzer sold certain property that was held for sale. The sale resulted in a pre-tax
gain of approximately $19.3 million, which will be recognized in the first quarter of 1996.
[note 16] proposed merger
In June 1994, the Company, Sierra Pacific Resources (SPR), Sierra Pacific Power Company, a subsidiary of SPR (SPPC),
and Altus Corporation, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (Altus, formerly named Resources West Energy Corporation),
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and Merger, dated as of June 27, 1994, as amended October 4, 1994
which provides for the merger of the Company, SPR and SPPC with and into Altus. In 1994, applications seeking approval of
the merger were filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and with the state utility commissions of
Washington Water Power 42California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. The Montana Public Service Commission issued an order in
October 1994 declining to exercise jurisdiction. The Company has received orders approving the merger from the commissions
of all the other states. On November 29, 1995, the FERC ordered evidentiary hearings concerning the proposed merger. An
administrative law judge has been assigned to the merger proceeding and a pre-hearing conference was held on December
13, 1995 to set a procedural schedule. The companies filed supplemental testimony on February 1, 1996. Hearings are
scheduled to begin on June 4, 1996. Based on this schedule, the companies believe an order could be issued by the FERC in
1996 or early 1997. The merger is designed to qualify as a pooling-of-interests for accounting and financial reporting
purposes. Under this method of accounting, the recorded assets and liabilities of the Company, SPR and SPPC will be carried
forward to the consolidated financial statements of Altus at their recorded amounts; income of Altus will include income of the
Company, SPR and SPPC for the entire fiscal year in which the merger occurs; and the reported income of the separate
corporations for prior periods will be combined and restated as income of Altus.
As of December 31, 1995, $14.5 million in merger transaction and transition costs have been deferred and are included on
the Company's balance sheet as Other Deferred Charges. The cost of severance and early retirement options elected by certain
eligible employees affected by the merger is expected to be approximately $8 million. The Company will determine the treatment
of these costs based on regulatory rulings, generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations. It is anticipated that for
accounting purposes these merger transaction and transition costs will be expensed by Altus in the quarter the merger is completed.
The following pro forma condensed financial information combines the historical consolidated balance sheets and
statements of income of the Company and SPR after giving effect to the merger. The unaudited pro forma condensed consoli-
:dated balance sheet at December 31, 1995 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred at December 31, 1995. The
each of the three years in the period ended December
unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of income
31, 1995 give effect to the merger as if it had occurred at January 1, 1993. These statements are prepared on the basis of
accounting for the merger as a pooling-of-interests and are based on the assumptions set forth in the paragraph below. The
pro forma condensed financial information has been prepared from, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's
historical consolidated audited financial statements and related notes thereto of which this note is a part and SPR's historical
consolidated audited financial statements and related notes thereto included in reports filed by SPR pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act, as amended. The information contained herein with respect to SPR and its subsidiaries has been supplied by
SPR. The information is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or operating results that would have occurred had the
merger been consummated on the date, or at the beginning of the periods, for which the merger is being given effect, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial position.
Intercompany transactions (including purchased and exchanged power transactions) between the Company and SPR
during the periods presented were not material and, accordingly, no pro forma adjustments were made to eliminate such
transactions. For comparative purposes, certain historical amounts have been reclassified to conform to the pro forma con-
densed financial statement format. The net cost savings estimated to be achieved by the merger are not reflected in the pro
forma financial statements. Pro forma per share data and common shares outstanding for Altus give effect to the conversion
of each share of WWP Common Stock into one share of Altus Common Stock and the conversion of each share of SPR Common
Stock into 1.44 shares of Altus Common Stock.

tures and streamflow conditions.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and statements of capitalization of The Washington
Water Power Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated
statements of income and retained earnings, cash flows, and the schedules of information by business segments for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements and schedules are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules based on our
audits.
$
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and schedules are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and schedules. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement and schedule presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
54,158
54,421
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements and schedules present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the Company and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. In addition, the schedules referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the segment information of the
Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
