********ΤΟ OUR STOCKHOLDERS
CALPINE ENTERED 1997 AS A NEW COMPANY, with new owners and a renewed
commitment to leadership in the deregulated U.S. power industry and the immense worldwide
power markets.
We are now a public company, owned by a prestigious group of investors, including leading
financial institutions, private investors, and Calpine management and employees. (An impressive
97% of our employees are now stockholders.) For strategic business reasons, Electrowatt Ltd., the
Swiss holding company that had been a shareholder since 1984, sold its entire interest in
Calpine in our September 1996 initial public equity offering. The relationship between Calpine
and Electrowatt was long and mutually rewarding. Electrowatt's support of Calpine enabled our
company to grow into an experienced, well-funded power company poised for powerful growth.
In 1996, we raised over $1 billion-including the sale of $317 million of Calpine common stock, a
$180 million debt offering, $95 million in corporate commercial bank financings, a $50 million
private placement and $364 million of non-recourse project debt. The $110 million Calpine received
from the initial public offering is being used to fund our acquisition and development program.
Some highlights of our 1996 performance include:
Revenue increased by 62% to $214.6 million.
Net income rose 153% to $18.7 million.
Earnings per share increased by 144% to $1.27.
• Plant availability was 95.8%, substantially above the industry average.
• Our assets grew by 86% to over $1 billion.
Calpine continued its dramatic growth by acquiring operating facilities and developing new
power plants.
We completed two important transactions in 1996, greatly strengthening our portfolio of low-cost
power generating facilities. In April, after an intense competition among many leading power
companies, we completed the King City transaction. We were successful, not by offering the
highest price, but by structuring an innovative, tax-efficient operating lease that created the
greatest value for the lessor and for Calpine. In August, we acquired the Gilroy gas-fired
power plant. Again, we were successful in winning this bid by creatively meeting the seller's
needs. Each of these 120 megawatt (mw) cogeneration plants supplies steam to a food processing
facility and electric power to Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Calpine has assumed management
and operation of both power plants. With these additions, our net interest in gas-fired projects
increased by 106% to 467 mw.
We entered 1997 with the strongest backlog of new acquisition opportunities in our history.
3One significant highlight of our development program in 1996 was closing the $150 million
non-recourse project financing for our Pasadena Power Plant in Texas. We are building this
240 mw gas-fired cogeneration facility using the Calpine Construct concept we developed for our
Sumas plant. Rather than using a turnkey contractor, Calpine is acting as project manager,
giving us the ability to achieve the lowest life-cycle plant costs. As a merchant plant, Pasadena
is an industry first. It will be a highly-efficient, low-cost power producer designed to sell most
of its power into the deregulated electric power market.
Pasadena will be the first plant of a planned $2.5 billion, 4,000 mw merchant plant program. Ten
additional low-cost. power plants are planned in California, Texas and other high-priced power
markets over the next seven years.
We also made significant progress in two new business areas in 1996.
Internationally, we completed our first full year of geothermal well drilling operations at Cerro
Prieto in northern Mexico. We are continuing development activities for geothermal projects in
Indonesia. At year-end, we also had development activities under way for a large number of
additional project opportunities in Asia, Latin America and Europe.
In 1996, there was great progress toward deregulating the $200 billion U.S. electric power
industry, California passed legislation which will open the state's $20 billion market to retail
competition beginning in 1998. Texas and states in the Northeast moved forward toward an
open, deregulated power market.
Deregulation at the wholesale level is already a reality, opening a $90 billion market to com-
petition. In March, we initiated trading power in this market. We began this program as a
strategic effort to establish the contracts, information and processes we will need to become a
national power company. We signed over 100 contracts that enable us to move power anywhere
in the western grid and throughout much of the remaining U.S. market. We bought and sold
5.5 million megawatt hours in 1996.
Later in this report we highlight three important business areas: performance of our power
projects, corporate and project financing, and our plans to grow Calpine. We also highlight three
people: Dave Farris, Sumas Plant Manager; Gabrielle Krafft, Financial Analyst; and Angelo
Urbani, Vice President-Construction. While each is indeed a superstar in a key business area, we
are showcasing them as representative of the many superstars at Calpine.
1996 was a remarkable year for all of us. With the dynamic team we have in place, I look forward
to a future bright with opportunity and growth.

POWERFUL PERFORMANCE
Our power facilities are the building blocks of the new Calpine. We count on them to generate
the maximum power at the lowest cost per kilowatt hour.
We achieve this by selecting the best equipment and the best operators. We then give our
operations staff at each facility full autonomy, plus the resources to run that facility at Inaximum
efficiency. Each plant is treated as a separate business, and our people take a proprietary
interest in obtaining the best possible performance from that business.
The results are impressive. One measure of performance is availability--the percent of time the
plant is delivering, or is capable of delivering, electric power to the grid. In 1996, our plants
were available 96.8% of the time. The 3.2% we were down covered all outages, both scheduled
maintenance as well as unplanned shutdowns. The industry average for similar gas-fired plants
is 89%. The 7.8% difference added directly to Calpine's bottom line. Our operations people are
proud of this, and so are we.
The proprietary interest our operators take in their plants results in reduced operating costs,
innovative solutions to problems and fierce determination to keep our plants running. In August
1996, when power line failures throughout the West cut off power for more than 7.5 million
utility customers, Calpine plants came back on line in minutes and poured enough power into
the northern California grid to supply over half a million customers who would otherwise have
been without electricity. At Sumas, our plant operated throughout a northern Washington cold
spell when wind chill temperatures dropped to -50°E And our Geysers geothermal plants and
steam fields operated without interruption through the heaviest rains and flooding in decades-
floods that washed out access to our Aidlin plant and disrupted transportation throughout The
Geysers region.

POWERFUL RETURNS
Power generation is a capital-intensive industry it takes substantial financial resources to
build or buy power plants. In 1996 alone, Calpine raised over $1 billion through the largest
initial public offering in the history of our industry, through our second public debt offering,
and through bank loans at both the corporate and project levels.
Our goal has always been to provide our investors with high returns on the funds they entrust
to us and to provide our lenders with security and certainty of the servicing of our debt. The
investors in the new Calpine include some of the most prestigious financial institutions in the
United States, Canada, Europe and Asia, as well as many individual investors, including
Calpine management and most employees. Calpine lenders include holders of Calpine public
debt, and leading international banks and financial institutions who finance our power plants
and steam fields.
We use Calpine's capital carefully and creatively to obtain the highest returns. In 1996, we won
a competition among 70 bidders to complete the King City transaction. We prevailed not by
offering the highest price, but by structuring an innovative, tax-efficient operating lease that
created the greatest value for the lessor and for Calpine. We won the Gilroy acquisition against
a higher bid by the largest company in our industry, again, by creatively meeting the seller's
needs. Finally, we closed a non-recourse project financing for the first merchant plant in the
industry, opening the door to a new era of profitable investment opportunities.
Calpine is moving forward as a new public company, with the same commitment we've always
had to provide powerful returns for our investors.

9"A traditional turnkey approach for our Sumas plant would have added
over $7 million to the cost of the project. We structured a unique alternative,
Calpine Construct. At Pasadena, we're building on our Sumas success
to create the most efficient gas-fired power plant in Texas."

Calpine will continue to grow by adding to our portfolio of power projects. We will pursue
that growth two ways-through acquisition of operating facilities and by development of
new power plants.
POWERFUL FUTURE
In the past, we relied most heavily on acquisitions. We have acquired over 800 mw of prime
generating facilities through carefully evaluating opportunities, selecting targets that meet our
stringent investment criteria, and aggressively and creatively pursuing those that add the most
value to Calpine.
As deregulation changes the composition of the U.S. power industry, more and more attractive
acquisition opportunities are being presented to Calpine. Opportunities arise from consolidation
of the independent power industry and from the sale of power plants owned by process industries.
In 1996, we added 240 mw of gas-fired power plants developed by food processing companies.
Another area of opportunity for Calpine: many investor-owned utilities are planning to sell their
generating assets as they focus on electric power transmission and distribution.
Development of new plants will be increasingly important to Calpine. In 1996, we launched a
program to develop highly-efficient, gas-fired power plants to sell electricity to customers in
deregulated markets. The Pasadena Power Plant in Texas will be our first entry into this new
market. When construction of this 240 mw plant is completed in 1998, it will be an industry
first-a merchant plant built to supply steam and electric power to a large industrial customer,
Phillips Petroleur Company, and to compete to sell the majority of its power into a deregulated
market. We've launched a program to build additional merchant plants in other attractive
markets across the country.
Over the last 12 years, we have created a solid foundation of experience and expertise in
Calpine. That foundation is enabling us to build a powerful future for our Company.
Calpine manages every element
of a power project's development-
from design, engineering and finance
through construction management,
fuel procurement and operations.
Calpine Construct
is an innovative alternative to
a traditional turnkey approach
to project development.

(3) The weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1996 gave effect to the issuance
of common stock upon the conversion of the Company's preferred stock in connection with the Company's initial public offering
(see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The presentation of fully diluted earnings per share for
the year ended 1996 is not required by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 15, because it results in dilution of less than 3%.
As adjusted primary earnings per share assuming conversion of preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 1995 is calculated
using average shares outstanding, which includes common share equivalents using the treasury stock method and the
assumed conversion of preferred stock to common stock as of January 1, 1995 in accordance with Securities and Exchange
Commission staff policy. Earnings per share prior to 1995 have not been presented since such amounts are not deemed meaningful
due to the significant change in the Company's capital structure that occurred in connection with its initial public offering.

EBITDA is defined as income from operations plus depreciation, capitalized interest, other income, non-cash charges and cash
received from investments in power projects, reduced by the income from unconsolidated investments in power projects. EBITDA
is presented not as a measure of operating results, but rather as a measure of the Company's ability to service debt. EBITDA should
not be construed as an alternative either (i) to income from operations (determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles) or (ii) to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles).
Consolidated Interest Expense is defined as total interest expense plus one-third of all operating lease obligations, capitalized interest,
dividends paid in respect of preferred stock and cash contributions to any employee stock ownership plan used to pay interest on
loans incurred to purchase capital stock of the Company.

GENERAL
Calpine is engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership and operation of power generation facilities and the
sale of electricity and steam in the United States and selected international markets. The Company has interests in
15 power generation facilities and steam fields having an aggregate capacity of 1,047 megawatts. Since its inception
in 1984, Calpine has developed substantial expertise in all aspects of electric power generation. The Company's
vertical integration has resulted in significant growth over the last five years as Calpine has applied its extensive
engineering, construction management, operations, fuel management and financing capabilities to successfully
implement its acquisition and development program. During the last five years, Calpine has expanded substantially,
from $55.4 million of total assets as of December 31, 1992 to $1.0 billion assets as of December 31, 1996. Calpine's
revenue for 1996 increased to $214.6 million, representing a compound annual growth rate of 52.6% since 1992.
The Company's EBITDA (see Selected Consolidated Financial Data) for 1996 increased to $117.4 million.
On September 9, 1994, the Company acquired Thermal Power Company, which owns a 25% undivided interest in
certain steam fields at The Geysers steam fields in northern California ("The Geysers") with a total capacity of 604
megawatts for a purchase price of $66.5 million. In January 1995, the Company purchased the working interest in
certain of the geothermal properties at the PG&E Unit 13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields from a third party for a purchase
price of $6.75 million. On April 21, 1995, the Company acquired the stock of certain companies that own 100% of
the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power Plants, consisting of two 49.5 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration facilities, for an
adjusted purchase price of $81.5 million. On June 29, 1995, the Company acquired the operating lease for the Watsonville
Power Plant, a 28.5 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, for a purchase price of $900,000. On November 17,
1995, the Company entered into a series of agreements to invest up to $20.0 million in the Cerro Prieto Steam Fields.
In April 1996, the Company entered into a lease transaction for the 120 megawatt King City Power Plant, which
required an investment of $108.3 million, primarily related to the collateral fund requirements. On August 29, 1996,
the Company acquired the Gilroy Power Plant, a 120 megawatt gas-fired cogeneration facility, for a purchase price of
$125.0 million plus certain contingent consideration, which the Company currently estimates will amount to approx-
imately $24.1 million.
Calpine Corporattan
18Each of the power generation facilities produces electricity for sale to a utility. Thermal energy produced by the gas-
fired cogeneration facilities is sold to governmental and industrial users, and steam produced by the geothermal
steam fields is sold to utility-owned power plants. The electricity, thermal energy and steam generated by these
facilities are typically sold pursuant to long-term take-and-pay power or steam sales agreements generally having orig-
inal terms of 20 or 30 years. Nine of these agreements with Pacific Gas and Electric Company ("PG&E") provides for
both capacity payments and energy payments for the term of the agreement. During the initial ten-year period of cer-
tain agreements, PG&E pays a fixed price for each unit of electrical energy according to schedules set forth in such
agreements. The fixed price periods under these power sales agreements expire at various times in 1998 through
2000. After the fixed price periods expire, while the basis for the capacity and capacity bonus payments under these
power sales agreements remains the same, the energy payments adjust to PG&E's then avoided cost of energy, which
is determined by the California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC"). The currently prevailing avoided cost of energy
is substantially lower than the fixed energy prices under these power sales agreements and is generally expected to
remain so. While avoided cost does not affect capacity payments under the power sales agreements, in the event that
the avoided cost of energy does not increase significantly, the Company's energy revenues under these power sales
agreements would be materially reduced at the expiration of the fixed price period. Such reduction may have a material
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. The Company cannot predict the likely level of avoided cost energy
prices at the expiration of the fixed price periods. Prices paid for the steam delivered by the Company's steam fields
are based on a formula that partially reflects the price levels of nuclear and fossil fuels, and, therefore, a reduction in
the price levels of such fuels may reduce revenue under the steam sales agreements for the steam fields.
Each of the Company's power and steam sales agreements contains curtailment provisions under which the
purchasers of energy or steam are entitled to reduce the number of hours of energy or amount of steam purchased
thereunder. During 1996, certain of the Company's power generation facilities experienced maximum curtailment
primarily as a result of low gas prices and a high degree of precipitation during the period, which resulted in high
levels of energy generation by hydroelectric power facilities that supply electricity. The Company expects maximum
curtailment during 1997 under its power and steam sales agreements for certain of its facilities.
Many states are implementing or considering regulatory initiatives designed to increase competition in the domestic
power generation industry. In December 1995, the CPUC issued an electric industry restructuring decision which
envisions commencement of deregulation and implementation of customer choice of electricity supplier by January 1,
1998 (see Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As part of its policy decision, the CPUC indi-
cated that power sales agreements of existing qualifying facilities ("QFs") would be honored. The Company cannot
predict the final form or timing of the proposed restructuring and the impact, if any, that such restructuring would
have on the Company's existing business or results of operations. The Company believes that any such restructuring
would not have a material effect on its power sales agreements and, accordingly, believes that its existing business
and results of operations would not be materially adversely affected, although there can be no assurance in this regard.
SELECTED OPERATING INFORMATION
Set forth below is certain selected operating information for the power generation facilities and steam fields, for which
results are consolidated in the Company's statements of operations. The information set forth under power plants
consists of the results for the West. Ford Flat Power Plant, the Bear Canyon Power Plant, the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power
Plants and the Watsonville Power Plant since their acquisitions on April 21, 1995 and June 29, 1995, respectively, the
Gilroy Power Plant since its acquisition on August 29, 1996, and the King City Power Plant since the effective date of
Calpine Corporation
19the lease on May 2, 1996. The information set forth under steam fields consists of the results for the PG&E Unit 13 and
Unit 16 Steam Fields, the SMUDGEO #1 Steam Fields and, for 1994 through 1996, the Thermal Power Company Steam
Fields since the acquisition of Thermal Power Company on September 9, 1994. The information provided for the other
interest included under steam revenue prior to 1995 represents revenue attributable to a working interest that was
held by a third party in the PG&E Unit 13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields. In January 1995, the Company purchased this
working interest. Prior to the Company's acquisition of the remaining interest in the West Ford Flat Power Plant, Bear
Canyon Power Plant, the PG&E Unit 13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields and the SMUDGEO #1 Steam Fields in April 1993,
the Company's revenue from these facilities was accounted for under the equity method and, therefore, does not
represent the actual revenue of the Company from these facilities for the periods set forth below.

RESULTS OF OPERATION$
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995
Revenue. Revenue increased 62% to $214.6 million in 1996 compared to $132.1 million in 1995, primarily due to a 56%
increase in electricity and steam sales of $199.5 million in 1996 compared to $127.8 million in 1995. The King City
Power Plant and the Gilroy Power Plant contributed revenues of $41.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, to electric
and steam sales revenue during 1996. Revenue for 1996 also reflected a full year of operation at the Greenleaf 1 and 2
Power Plants and the Watsonville Power Plant which contributed increases in electric and steam revenue in 1996 com-
pared to 1995 of $9.1 million and $4.7 million, respectively. During 1996 and 1995, the Company experienced the
maximum curtailment allowed under the power sales agreements with PG&E for the West Ford Flat and Bear Canyon
Power Plants. Without such curtailment, the West Ford Flat and Bear Canyon Power Plants would have generated an
additional $5.7 million and $5.2 million of revenue in 1996 and 1995, respectively. Service contract revenue decreased to
$6.5 million in 1996 compared to $7.2 million in 1995, reflecting a $2.8 million loss related to the Company's electricity
trading operations, offset by increased revenue during 1996 related to overhauls at the Aidlin and Agnews PowerPlants, and to technical services performed for the Cerro Prieto project. Income from unconsolidated investments in
power projects increased to $6.5 million in 1996 compared to losses of $2.9 million during 1995. The increase is pri-
marily attributable to $6.4 million of equity income generated by the Company's investment in Sumas Cogeneration
Company, L.P. ("Sumas") during 1996 compared to a $3.0 million loss in 1995. The increase in Sumas' profitability
during 1996 is primarily attributable to a contractual increase in the energy price in accordance with the power sales
agreement with Puget Sound Power & Light Company. Interest income on loans to power projects was $2.1 million in
1996 as a result of the recognition of interest income on loans to the sole shareholder of the general partner in Sumas.
Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased 67% to $129.2 million in 1996 as compared to $77.4 million in 1995. The
increase was primarily due to plant operating, depreciation, and operating lease expenses attributable to (i) a full year
of operation during 1996 at the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power Plants which were purchased on April 21, 1995, (ii) a full
year of operation during 1996 at the Watsonville Power Plant which was acquired on June 29, 1995, (iii) operations
at the King City Power Plant subsequent to May 2, 1996, and (iv) operations at the Gilroy Power Plant subsequent to
acquisition on August 29, 1996. Cost of revenue also increased due to service contract expenses related to the Cerro
Prieto Steam Fields, partially offset by lower operating expenses at the Company's other existing power generation
facilities and steam fields.
Project development expenses. Project development expenses increased to $3.9 million in 1996, compared to $3.1 million
in 1995, due to project development activities.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $14.7 million in 1996 compared to
$8.9 million in 1995. The increases were primarily due to additional personnel and related expenses necessary to
support the Company's expanding operations, including the Company's power marketing operations. The Company
also incurred an employee bonus expense of $1.4 million in September 1996 related to the initial public offering.
Interest expense. Interest expense increased 41% to $45.3 million in 1996 from $32.2 million in 1995. Approximately
$11.8 million of the increase was attributable to interest on the Company's 102% Senior Notes Due 2006 issued in
May 1996, $2.7 million of interest expense related to the Gilroy Power Plant acquired on August 29, 1996, and $1.6 million
of higher interest expense related to the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power Plants acquired on April 21, 1995, offset in part by
a $3.0 million decrease in interest expense as a result of repayments of principal on certain non-recourse project financings.
Other income, net. Other income, net increased 232% to $6.3 million for 1996 compared with $1.9 million for 1995.
The increase was primarily due to $4.5 million of interest income on collateral securities purchased in connection with
the King City transaction, $1.4 million of net proceeds for the settlement of the Coso project, and higher interest income
for the period due to the investment of the net proceeds of the preferred stock, the 101/2% Senior Notes Due 2006, and
from the Company's initial public offering of common shares. Offsetting these income items was a $3.7 million loss for uncol-
lectible amounts related to the O'Brien acquisition project (see Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Provision for income taxes. The effective rate for the income tax provision was approximately 33% in 1996 and 41% in
1995. In 1996, the Company decreased its deferred income tax liability by $769,000 to reflect the change in California's
state income tax rate from 9.3% to 8.84% effective January 1, 1997. In addition, depletion in excess of tax basis
benefits at the Company's geothermal facilities and a revision of prior years' tax estimates reduced the Company's
effective tax rate for 1996.
Calpine Corporation
21YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1994
Revenue increased 39% to $132.1 million in 1995 compared to $94.8 million in 1994, primarily due to a 42% increase
in electricity and steam sales to $127.8 million in 1995 compared to $90.3 million in 1994. Such an increase was
primarily attributable to the $28.3 million of revenue from the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power Plants, $5.9 million of
revenue from the Watsonville Power Plant, the $5.2 million of additional revenue from the Thermal Power Company
Steam Fields as a result of a full year of operation in 1995, and an increase of $3.0 million of revenue from the SMUDGEO #1
Steam Fields attributable to increased production as a result of an extended outage during 1994. Such an increase
also reflects a substantial increase in capacity payments for electricity sales from $8.0 million in 1994 to $30.5 million
in 1995 as a result of the transactions stated above. This revenue increase was partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease
in revenue from the West Ford Flat and Bear Canyon Power Plants as a result of curtailments by PG&E due to low gas
prices and high levels of precipitation during 1995 as compared to 1994, offset in part by contractual price increas-
es for 1995. Without such curtailment, the West Ford Flat and Bear Canyon Power Plants would have generated an
additional $5.2 million of revenue in 1995. Revenue for 1995 also reflects curtailment of steam production at the
Thermal Power Company Steam Fields as a result of higher precipitation and lower gas prices in 1995, and at the
PG&E Unit 13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields as a result of hydro-spill conditions. Without curtailment, the Thermal Power
Company Steam Fields and the PG&E Unit 13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields would have generated an additional $5.7 million
and $800,000 of revenue during 1995, respectively.
Revenue for 1995 and 1994 reflects reversals of $2.7 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of previously deferred
revenue. Company revenue from sales of steam was previously calculated considering a future period when steam
would be delivered without receiving corresponding revenue. In May 1994, the Company ceased deferring revenue
and recognized $4.0 million of its previously deferred revenue. Based on estimates and analyses performed by the
Company, the Company no longer expects that it will be required to make these deliveries to SMUD. Concurrently,
$800,000 of the revenue increase was reserved for future construction of gathering systems required for future
production of the steam fields, with the offset recorded in property, plant and equipment. In October 1995, PG&E
agreed to the termination of the free steam provision with respect to the PG&E Unit 13 Steam Fields. During 1995,
the Company took additional measures regarding future capital commitments and other actions which will increase
steam production and, based on additional analyses and estimates performed, the Company recognized the remaining
$2.7 million of previously deferred revenue.
Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased 47% to $77.4 million in 1995 compared to $52.8 million in 1994. The
increase was due to plant operating, production royalty and depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to
(i) a full year of operations at Thermal Power Company, which was purchased on September 9, 1994, (ii) operations
at the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power Plants subsequent to April 21, 1995, and (iii) operations at the Watsonville Power Plant
subsequent to June 29, 1995. The increases were partially offset by lower depreciation and production royalty
expenses at the West Ford Flat and Bear Canyon Power Plants and the PG&E Unit 13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields due
to curtailment by PG&E during 1995.
Project development expenses. Project development expenses increased to $3.1 million in 1995 compared to $1.8 million
in 1994, due to new project development activities.
General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were $8.9 million in 1995 compared to $7.3 million
in 1994. The increase in 1995 was primarily due to additional personnel and related expenses necessary to support
the Company's expanded operations.
Calpine Corporation
22Interest expense. Interest expense increased to $32.2 million in 1995 from $23.9 million in 1994. Approximately $3.6 million
of the increase was attributable to a full year of interest expense incurred on the debt related to the Thermal Power
Company acquisition in September 1994 and $4.1 million of interest expense incurred on the debt related to the
Greenleaf transaction in April 1995. In addition, 1995 included a full year of interest expense on the 94% Senior Notes
Due 2004 issued on February 17, 1994.
Provision for income taxes. The effective rate for the income tax provision was approximately 41% for 1995 and 39% for
1994. The effective rates were based on statutory tax rates, with minor reductions for depletion in excess of tax basis
benefits. Due to curtailment of production during 1995, the allowance for statutory depletion decreased in 1995 from 1994.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
To date, the Company has obtained cash from its operations, borrowings under its credit facilities and other working
capital lines, sale of debt and equity, and proceeds from non-recourse project financings. The Company utilized this
cash to fund its operations, service debt obligations, fund the acquisition, development and construction of power gen-
eration facilities, finance capital expenditures and meet its other cash and liquidity needs.
The following table summarizes the Company's cash flow activities for the periods indicated:

Operating activities for 1996 consisted of approximately $18.7 million of net income from operations, $36.6 million of
depreciation and amortization, $2.0 million in deferred income taxes, and $7.8 million net increas operating assets
and liabilities, offset by $5.3 million of undistributed income from unconsolidated investments in power projects.
Investing activities used $326.8 million during 1996, primarily due to $29.9 million of capital expenditures and
capitalized project costs, $98.4 million for the purchase of collateral securities, a $12.9 million loan to Coperlasa in
connection with the Cerro Prieto project, $138.1 million for the acquisition of the Gilroy Power Plant, and a $41.6 million
increase in restricted cash requirements related to the construction of the Pasadena Power Plant,
Calpine Corporation
Financing activities provided $345.2 million of cash during 1996. The Company issued $50.0 million of preferred stock
to Electrowatt, borrowed $161.8 million of bank debt and an additional $46.9 million under the credit facilities,
received net proceeds of $174.9 million from the 101/2% Senior Notes Due 2006, and received $109.2 million upon the
issuance of common stock. The Company subsequently repaid $46.2 million of bank debt, all borrowings outstanding
under the credit facilities of $66.7 million, and $84.7 million of non-recourse project financing.
As of December 31, 1996, cash and cash equivalents were $100.0 million and working capital was $96.2 million. For
the twelve months ended December 31, 1996, working capital increased by $145.2 million and cash and cash equivalents
increased by $78.2 million as compared to the comparable period in 1995. The increase in working capital is primarily
due to remaining net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in September 1996, and reflects the inclusion of
$57.0 million of non-recourse project financing in current liabilities as of December 31, 1995. On May 16, 1996, the
TCompany issued the 101/2% Senior Notes Due 2006. A portion of the funds from the issuance of the 101/2% Senior
Notes Due 2006 was used to refinance current bank debt and borrowings under the Credit Suisse credit facility, and
to repay the $57.0 million non-recourse indebtedness to The Bank of Nova Scotia.
As a developer, owner and operator of power generation projects, the Company may be required to make long-term
commitments and investments of substantial capital for its projects. The Company historically has financed these capital
requirements with borrowings under its credit facilities, other lines of credit, non-recourse project financing or long-
term debt.
The Company currently has outstanding $105.0 million of 94% Senior Notes Due 2004 which mature on February 1,
2004 and bear interest payable semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. In addition, the Company has
$180.0 million of 101/2% Senior Notes Due 2006 which mature on May 15, 2006 and bear interest semi-annually on
May 15 and November 15 of each year. Under the provisions of the applicable indentures, the Company may, under
certain circumstances, be limited in its ability to make restricted payments, as defined, which include dividends and
certain purchases and investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain transactions.
At December 31, 1996, the Company had $309.3 million of non-recourse project financing associated with power
generating facilities and steam fields at the West Ford Flat Power Plant, the Bear Canyon Power Plant, the PG&E Unit
13 and Unit 16 Steam Fields, the SMUDGEO #1 Steam Fields, the Greenleaf 1 and 2 Power Plants and the Gilroy
Power Plant. As of December 31, 1996, the annual maturities for all non-recourse project financing were $30.6 million
for 1997, $32.7 million for 1998, $24.2 million for 1999, $24.8 million for 2000, $24.6 million for 2001 and $170.5
million thereafter.
The Company currently has a $50.0 million revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial lending
institutions led by The Bank of Nova Scotia, with borrowings bearing interest at either LIBOR or at The Bank of Nova
Scotia base rate plus a mutually agreed margin. At December 31, 1996, the Company had no borrowings outstanding
and $5.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility (see Note 16 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). The Bank of Nova Scotia credit facility contains certain restrictions that signifi-
cantly limit or prohibit, among other things, the ability of the Company or its subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, make
payments of certain indebtedness, pay dividends, make investments, engage in transactions with affiliates, create
liens, sell assets and engage in mergers and consolidations.
The Company has a $1.2 million working capital line with a commercial lender that may be used to fund short-term
working capital commitments and letters of credit. At December 31, 1996, the Company had no borrowings under
this working capital line and $900,000 of letters of credit outstanding. Borrowings are at prime plus 1%.
The Company also has outstanding a non-interest bearing promissory note to Natomas Energy Company in the
amount of $6.5 million representing a portion of the September 1994 purchase price of Thermal Power Company.
This note has been discounted to yield 8% per annum and is due September 9, 1997.
The Company intends to continue to seek the use of non-recourse project financing for new projects, where appro-
priate. The debt agreements of the Company's subsidiaries and other affiliates governing the non-recourse project
financing generally restrict their ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to the
Company. The dividend restrictions in such agreements generally require that, prior to the payment of dividends,
Calpine Corporation
24distributions or other transfers, the subsidiary or other affiliate must provide for the payment of other obligations,
including operating expenses, debt service and reserves. However, the Company does not believe that such restric-
tions will adversely affect its ability to meet its debt obligations.
At December 31, 1996, the Company had commitments for capital expenditures in 1997 totaling $4.0 million related
to various projects at its geothermal facilities. The Company intends to fund capital expenditures for the ongoing
operation and development of the Company's power generation facilities primarily through the operating cash flow
of such facilities. Capital expenditures for 1996 were $30.2 million compared to $17.4 million for 1995, primarily due
to the purchase of new equipment. For 1996, capital expenditures included $12.5 million related to the Pasadena
Power Plant, $4.0 million for the purchase of geothermal leases for the Glass Mountain project, $3.1 million for the
new rotor at the PG&E Unit 13 facility, $3.2 million for geothermal well drilling, $2.1 million for a reinjection pipeline
at the Company's geothermal steam fields, and $5.4 million of capital expenditures at various cogeneration facilities.
The Company continues to pursue the acquisition and development of new power generation projects. The Company
expects to commit significant capital in future years for the acquisition and development of these projects. The
Company's actual capital expenditures may vary significantly during any year.
The Company believes that it will have sufficient líquidity from cash flow from operations and borrowings available
under the lines of credit and working capital to satisfy all obligations under outstanding indebtedness, to finance
anticipated capital expenditures and to fund working capital requirements.
IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT
In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which
simplifies the standards for computing earnings per share previously found in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
("APBO") No. 15. SFAS No. 128 replaces the presentation of primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic
earnings per share, which excludes dilution. SFAS No. 128 also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings
per share on the face of the income statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a recon-
ciliation. Diluted earnings per share is computed similarly to fully diluted earnings per share pursuant to APBO No.
15. SFAS No. 128 must be adopted for financial statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997, including
interim periods; earlier application is not permitted. SFAS No. 128 requires restatement of all prior-period earnings per
share data presented. The Company has not yet quantified the effect of adopting SFAS No. 128.

25REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF CALPINE CORPORATION:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Calpine Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1996. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Sumas Cogeneration Company, L.P.
("Sumas"), the investment in which is reflected in the accompanying financial statements using the equity method of
accounting. The investment in Sumas represents approximately 1% of the Company's total assets at December 31,
1996 and 1995. The Company has recorded income of $6.4 million and losses of $3.0 million and $2.9 million repre-
senting its share of the net income or loss of Sumas for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respec-
tively. The financial statements of Sumas were audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us and
our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for Sumas, is based solely on the report of other auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the
report of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Calpine Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996
and 1995, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES ΤΟ CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1995 AND 1994
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY
Calpine Corporation ("Calpine"), a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") are engaged in
the development, acquisition, ownership and operation of power generation facilities in the United States and selected
international markets. The Company has ownership interests in and operates geothermal steam fields, geothermal
power generation facilities, and natural gas-fired cogeneration facilities in northern California and Washington. Each
of the generation facilities produces electricity for sale to utilities. Thermal energy produced by the gas-fired cogen-
eration facilities is sold to governmental and industrial users, and steam produced by the geothermal steam fields is
sold to utility-owned power plants. For the year ended December 31, 1996, primarily all electricity and steam sales
revenue from consolidated subsidiaries was derived from sales to two customers in northern California (see Note 27),
of which 48% related to geothermal activities. In 1996, the Company began marketing power and energy services to
utilities and other end users.
In July 1996, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the reincorporation of the Company into Delaware in
connection with the Company's initial public offering. In addition, the Board of Directors approved a stock split of
approximately 5.194-for-1. On September 13, 1996, the reincorporation of the Company and the stock split became
effective. The accompanying financial statements reflect the reincorporation and the stock split as if such transactions
had been effective for all periods (see Note 24).
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Calpine Corporation and its
wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated
in consolidation. Prior to 1994, the Company acquired Calpine Geysers Company, L.P. ("CGC"). During 1994, the
Company formed Calpine Thermal Power, Inc. ("Calpine Thermal") and Calpine Siskiyou Geothermal Partners, L.P.
(see Notes 4 and 7, respectively). Calpine Thermal acquired Thermal Power Company ("TPC") during 1994. During
1995, the Company formed Calpine Greenleaf Corporation ("Calpine Greenleaf"), Calpine Monterey Cogeneration, Inc.
("CMCI") and Calpine Vapor, Inc. ("Calpine Vapor"). Calpine Greenleaf indirectly acquired two operating gas-fired
cogeneration plants (see Note 5) and CMCI acquired an operating lease for a gas-fired cogeneration facility (see Note
6). Calpine Vapor made loans to fund construction of new geothermal wells in Mexico (see Note 8). During 1996, the
Company formed Calpine King City Cogen L.L.C. ("CKCC"), Calpine Gilroy Cogen, L.P. ("Gilroy"), and Pasadena
Cogeneration, L.P. CKCC completed an operating lease transaction for a gas-fired cogeneration plant (see Note 9) and
Calpine Gilroy acquired the assets of a gas-fired cogeneration plant in California (see Note 10). In December 1996,
Pasadena Cogeneration entered into an energy sales agreement and will construct a 240 megawatt gas-fired power plant
(see Note 11).
Accounting for Jointly Owned Geothermal Properties. The Company uses the proportionate consolidation method to
account for TPC's 25% interest in jointly owned geothermal properties. TPC has a steam sales agreement with Pacific
Gas and Electric Company ("PG&E") pursuant to which the steam derived from its interest in the properties is sold (see Note 4).
Calpine Corporation
31Use of Estimates in Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial state-
ments and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to future devel-
opment costs and total productive resources of the geothermal facilities (see Property, Plant and Equipment and Note 7),
the estimated "free steam" liability (see Note 3), receivables which the Company believes to be collectible (see Note 15)
and the realization of deferred income taxes (see Note 21). Additionally, the Company believes that certain industry
restructuring (see Note 28, Regulation and CPUC Restructuring) will not have a material effect on existing power service
agreements ("PSA") and, accordingly, will not have a material effect on existing business or results of operations.
Revenue Recognition. Revenue from electricity and steam sales is recognized upon transmission to the customer.
Revenues from contracts entered into or acquired since May 21, 1992 are recognized at the lesser of amounts billable
under the contract or amounts recognizable at an average rate over the term of the contract. The Company's power
sales agreements related to CGC were entered into prior to May 1992. Had the Company applied this principle, the
revenues of the Company recorded for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, would have been approx-
imately $16.1 million, $12.6 million, and $11.9 million less, respectively.
The Company performs operations and maintenance services for all projects in which it has an interest, except for
TPC and the geothermal investment in Mexico. Revenue from investees is recognized on these contracts when the
services are performed. Revenue from consolidated subsidiaries is eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three
months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these instruments approximates fair value because of
their short maturity.
Restricted Cash. The Company is required to maintain cash balances that are restricted by provisions of its debt agree-
ments and by regulatory agencies. The Company's debt agreements specify restrictions based on debt service pay-
ments and drilling costs for the following year. Regulatory agencies require cash to be restricted to ensure that funds
will be available to restore property to its original condition. Restricted cash is invested in accounts earning market
rates; therefore, the carrying value approximates fair value. Such cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents for
the purposes of the statements of cash flows.
Investment in Collateral Securities. The Company's investments in collateral securities are related to the King City
transaction (see Note 9) and are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost. The investments in debt
securities mature at various dates through August 2018 in amounts equal to a portion of the lease payment. The fair value
of held-to-maturity securities was determined based on the quoted market prices at the reporting date for the securities.
The components of held-to-maturity securities by major security type as of December 31, 1996 are as follows (in thousands):

UNREALIZEDConcentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of cash and accounts / notes receivable. The Company's cash accounts are held by eight major
financial institutions. The Company's accounts / notes receivable are concentrated within entities engaged in the
energy industry, mainly within the United States, some of which are related parties. Certain of the Company's notes
receivable are with a company in Mexico (see Note 15).
Property, Plant and Equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.
The Company capitalizes costs incurred in connection with the development of geothermal properties, including costs
of drilling wells and overhead directly related to development activities, together with the costs of production equip-
ment, the related facilities and the operating power plants. Geothermal properties include the value attributable to
the geothermal resources of CGC and all of the property, plant and equipment of Calpine Thermal. Proceeds from the
sale of geothermal properties are applied against capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized.
Geothermal costs, including an estimate of future development costs to be incurred and the estimated costs to
dismantle, are amortized by the units of production method based on the estimated total productive output over the
estimated useful lives of the related steam fields. Depreciation of the buildings and roads is computed using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of useful lives, total
units of production or total capital costs to be amortized using the units of production method could differ materially
in the near term from the amounts assumed in arriving at current depreciation expense. These estimates are affected
by such factors as the ability of the Company to continue selling steam and electricity to customers at estimated
prices, changes in prices of alternative sources of energy such as hydro-generation and gas, and changes in the reg-
ulatory environment.
Gas-fired power production facilities include the cogeneration plants and related equipment and are stated at cost.
Depreciation is recorded utilizing the straight-line method over the estimated original useful life of up to thirty years.
The value of the above-market pricing provided in PSAs acquired is recorded in property, plant and equipment and is
amortized over the life of the PSA or operating lease. When assets are disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the resulting gains or losses are included in the results of operations.
As of December 31, 1996 and 1995, the components of property, plant and equipment are as follows (in thousands):

Investments in Power Projects. The Company accounts for its unconsolidated investments in power projects under the
equity method. The Company's share of income from these investments is calculated according to the Company's
equity ownership or in accordance with the terms of the appropriate partnership agreement (see Note 14).

$447,751Capitalized Project Costs. The Company capitalizes project development costs upon the execution of a memorandum
of understanding or a letter of intent for a power or steam sales agreement. These costs include professional services,
salaries, permits and other costs directly related to the development of a new project. Outside services and other
third-party costs are capitalized for acquisition projects. Upon the start-up of plant operations or the completion of an
acquisition, these costs are generally transferred to property, plant and equipment and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the project. Capitalized project costs are charged to expense when the Company determines that the
project will not be consummated or is impaired.
Earnings Per Share and As Adjusted Earnings Per Share. For the calendar year ending after the Company's initial public
offering in September 1996, net income per share was computed using the weighted average number of common and
common equivalent shares using the treasury stock method for outstanding stock options. Net income per share also
gives effect to common equivalent shares from convertible preferred shares from the original date of issuance that
automatically converted upon completion of the Company's initial public offering (using the if-converted method).
For the year ended December 31, 1995, as adjusted net income per share was computed using the weighted average
number of common equivalent shares, which includes the net additional number of shares which would be issuable
upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, assuming the Company used the proceeds received to purchase addi-
tional shares at an assumed public offering price. Net income per share also gives effect to common equivalent shares
from preferred stock that converted upon the closing of the Company's initial public offering assuming such shares
were outstanding from the beginning of the period in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission staff policy.
Earnings per share prior to 1995 have not been presented since such amounts are not deemed meaningful due to the
significant change in the Company's capital structure that occurred in connection with its initial public offering.
Power Marketing. The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary Calpine Power Services Company ("CPSC"), markets
power and energy services to utilities, wholesalers, and end users. CPSC provides these services by entering into con-
tracts to purchase or supply electricity at specified delivery points and specified future dates. In some cases, CPSC
utilizes option agreements to manage its exposure to market fluctuations. At December 31, 1996, CPSC held forward
sales and purchase contracts with notional quantities of approximately 724,000 megawatt hours and 631,600 megawatt
hours, respectively.
Net open positions may exist due to the origination of new transactions and the Company's evaluation of changing
market conditions. The open position exposes the Company to the risk that fluctuating market prices may adversely
impact its financial position or results of operations. However, the net open position is actively managed. The impact
of such fluctuations on the Company's financial position is not necessarily indicative of the impact of price fluctua-
tions throughout the year. CPSC values its portfolio using the aggregate lower of cost or market method. An allowance
is recorded currently for net aggregate losses of the entire portfolio resulting from the effect of market changes on
the net open positions. Net gains are recognized when realized.
With respect to open power contracts, CPSC has established certain reserves and allowances, principally for adverse
changes in market conditions prior to termination of the commitments. At December 31, 1996, the Company had
recorded allowances of approximately $917,000 which is included in Service contract revenue in the accompanying
consolidated statement of operations.
Calpine Corporation
34The Company's credit risk associated with power contracts results from the risk of loss as a result of non-performance
by counterparties. The Company reviews and assesses counterparty risk to limit any material impact to its financial
position and results of operations. The Company does not anticipate non-performance by the counterparties. The
Company sets credit limits prior to entering into transactions and has not obtained collateral or other security.
Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements. In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of. This pronouncement requires that long-lived assets and certain iden-
tifiable intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is to be recognized when the sum of undis-
counted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Measurement of the loss for assets that the
entity expects to hold and use are to be based on the fair market value of the asset. The Company adopted SFAS No. 121
effective January 1, 1996, and determined that adoption of this pronouncement had no material impact on the results
of operations or financial condition as of January 1, 1996.
In February 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share, which simplifies the standards for computing
earnings per share previously found in Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APBO") No. 15. SFAS No. 128 replaces
the presentation of primary earnings per share with a presentation of basic earnings per share, which excludes dilution.
SFAS No. 128 also requires dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the income statement
for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation. Diluted earnings per share is computed
similarly to fully diluted earnings per share pursuant to APBO No. 15. SFAS No. 128 must be adopted for financial
statements issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997, including interim periods; earlier application is not
permitted. SFAS No. 128 requires restatement of all prior-period earnings per share data presented. The Company
has not yet quantified the effect of adopting SFAS No. 128.
Reclassifications. Prior years' amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified where neces-
sary to conform to the 1996 presentation.
3. CALPINE GEYSERS COMPANY, L. P.
CGC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is the owner of two operating geothermal power plants and their
respective steam fields, Bear Canyon and West Ford Flat, and three geothermal steam fields, which provide steam to
PG&B's Unit 13 and Unit 16 power plants and to Sacramento Municipal Utility District's ("SMUD") geothermal power
plant. The power plants and steam fields are located in The Geysers area of northern California. Electricity from CGC's
two operating geothermal power plants is sold to PG&E under 20-year agreements.
Under the PG&E Unit 16 and the SMUD agreements, if the quantity of steam delivered is less than 50% of the units'
capacities, then neither PG&E nor SMUD is required to make payment for steam delivered during such month until
the cost of the affected power plant has been completely amortized. Further, both PG&E and SMUD can terminate
their agreements with written notice under conditions specified in the agreement if further operation of the plants
becomes uneconomical. In the event that CGC terminates the agreements, PG&E or SMUD may require CGC to assign
them all rights, title and interest to the wells, lands and related facilities. In consideration for such an assignment to
SMUD, SMUD shall reimburse CGC for its original costs net of depreciation for any associated materials or facilities.
Calpine Corporation
35CGC revenues from sales of steam were calculated considering a future period when steam would be delivered without
receiving corresponding revenue. The estimated "free steam" obligation was recorded at an average rate over future
steam production as deferred revenue in 1993. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had deferred revenue of $8.6 million.
During 1994, based on estimates and analyses performed, the Company determined that these deliveries would no
longer be required for a customer and reversed approximately $5.9 million of its deferred revenue liability. This reversal
was recorded as a $1.9 million purchase price reduction to property, plant and equipment, with the remaining $4.0
million as an increase in revenue. Concurrently, $800,000 of the revenue increase was reserved for future construc-
tion of gathering systems required for future production of the steam fields, with the offset recorded in property, plant
and equipment.
In October 1994, PG&E agreed to the termination of the free steam provision for one of the geothermal steam fields.
During 1995, CGC took additional measures regarding future capital commitments and other actions which will
increase steam production and, based on additional analyses and estimates performed, the Company recognized the
remaining $2.7 million of previously deferred revenue.
On April 19, 1993, the Company acquired Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners, L.P.'s ("FMRP") interest in CGC for
$23.0 million in cash and non-recourse notes payable to FMRP totaling $40.5 million. On February 17, 1994, the
Company exercised its option to prepay the notes utilizing a discount rate of 10% by paying $36.9 million including
interest in full satisfaction of its obligations under the FMRP notes. The difference between the original carrying
amount of the notes and the prepayment was recorded as an adjustment to the purchase price.
CALPINE THERMAL POWER, INC.
On September 9, 1994, Calpine Thermal acquired the outstanding capital stock of TPC for a total purchase price of
$66.5 million, consisting of a $60.0 million cash payment and the issuance by Calpine of a non-interest bearing
promissory note to Natomas in the amount of $6.5 million (discounted to $5.2 million), which is due September 9,
1997. Calpine received payments of $3.0 million from the seller, which represented cash from TPC's operations for
the period from July 1, 1994 to September 8, 1994. These payments were treated as purchase price adjustments.
Calpine Thermal owns a 25% undivided interest in certain producing geothermal steam fields located at The Geysers
area of northern California. Union Oil Company of California owns the remaining 75% interest in the steam fields,
which deliver geothermal steam to twelve operating plants owned by PG&E. The steam fields currently provide the
twelve operating plants with sufficient steam to generate approximately 604 megawatts of electricity.
Steam from Calpine Thermal's steam field is sold to PG&E under a steam sales agreement. In addition, Calpine
Thermal receives a monthly capacity maintenance fee, which provides for effluent disposal costs and facilities support
costs, and a monthly fee for PG&E's right to curtail its power plants. The steam price, capacity maintenance and
curtailment fees are adjusted annually. Calpine Thermal is required to compensate PG&E for the unused capacity of
its geothermal power plants due to insufficient field capacities of its steam supply (offset payment).
In accordance with the steam sales agreement, PG&E may curtail the power plants which receive steam from the
Union Oil/Calpine Thermal Steam Fields in order to produce energy from lower cost sources. However, PG&E is
constrained by its contractual obligation to operate all the power plants at a minimum of 40% of the field capacity
during any given year. During 1995 and 1996, Calpine Thermal experienced extensive curtailments of steam pro-
duction due to low gas prices and abundant hydro power.
Calpine Corporation
36In March 1996, the Company and Union Oil entered into an alternative pricing agreement with PG&E for any steam
produced in excess of 40% of average field capacity as defined in the steam sales contract. The alternative pricing
agreement is effective through December 31, 2000. Under the alternative pricing agreement, PG&E has the option
to purchase a portion of the steam PG&E would likely curtail under the existing steam sales agreement. The price for
this portion of steam will be set by the Company and Union Oil with the intent that it be at competitive prices.
The steam sales agreement between Calpine Thermal and PG&E terminates two years after the closing of the last
PG&E operating unit. PG&E may terminate the agreement upon a one-year written notice to Calpine Thermal. In the
event the agreement is terminated by PG&E, Calpine Thermal has the right to purchase PG&E's facilities at PG&E's
unamortized cost. Calpine Thermal will provide capacity maintenance services for five years after termination by
PG&E or closure of the last PG&E operating unit. Alternatively, Calpine Thermal may terminate the agreement upon
a two-year written notice to PG&E. PG&E has the right to take assignment of Calpine Thermal's facilities on the date
of termination. In such a case, Calpine Thermal would generally continue to pay offset payments for 36 months fol-
lowing the date of termination.
5. CALPINE GREENLEAF CORPORATION
On April 21, 1995, Calpine Greenleaf acquired the outstanding capital stock of Portsmouth Leasing Corporation, LFC
No. 38 Corp. and LFC No. 60 Corp. (collectively, the "Acquired Companies") for $80.5 million. The purchase price
included a cash payment of $20.3 million and the assumption of project debt totaling $60.2 million. In April 1996,
the Company finalized the purchase price.
The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase, and the purchase price has been allocated to the acquired assets
and liabilities based on their estimated fair values. The adjusted allocation of the purchase price is as follows (in thousands):
Current assets
Property, plant and equipment

The Acquired Companies own 100% of the assets of two 49.5 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration facilities
Greenleaf 1 and Greenleaf 2 (collectively, the "Greenleaf Power Plants"), located in Yuba City in northern California.
Electrical energy generated by the Greenleaf Power Plants is sold to PG&E pursuant to two long-term PSAs (expiring
in 2019) at prices equal to PG&E's full short-run avoided operating costs, adjusted annually. The PSA also includes
payment provisions for firm capacity payments through 2019 for up to 49.2 megawatts on each unit and as-delivered
capacity on excess deliveries. PG&E, at its discretion, may curtail purchases of electricity from the Greenleaf Power
Plants due to hydro-spill or uneconomic cost conditions. The thermal energy generated is used by thermal hosts adjacent
to the Greenleaf Power Plants.

376. CALPINE MONTEREY COGENERATION, INC.
On June 29, 1995, CMCI acquired a 14.5-year operating lease (through December 2009) for a 28.5 megawatt natural
gas-fired cogeneration power plant located in Watsonville, California. The Company acquired the operating lease from
Ford Motor Credit Company for $900,000. The Watsonville Power Plant sells electricity to PG&E under a 20-year PSA,
generally at prices equal PG&E's full short-run avoided operating costs. Basic and contingent lease rental payments
are described in Note 26. The power plant also provides steam to two local food processing plants. The Company also
provides project and fuels management services.
7. CALPINE SISKIYOU GEOTHERMAL PARTNERS, L.P.
In 1994, the Company formed a partnership with Trans-Pacific Geothermal Corporation ("TGC") to build a geothermal
power generation facility located at Glass Mountain in northern California. TGC had previously signed a memoran-
dum of understanding ("MOU") with Bonneville Power Administration ("BPA") and the Springfield, Oregon Utility
Board ("SUB") to develop the project at Vale, Oregon, BPA and SUB consented in August 1994 to the assignment of
the MOU to the partnership and the relocation of the project to Glass Mountain. The MOU contemplated execution of
a 45-year power purchase agreement subject to satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and included an option
for an additional 100 megawatts. The partnership is consolidated as the Company owns a controlling interest.
In December 1996, the partnership and BPA entered into a settlement agreement which restructured the rights and
obligations of the parties. In return for the payment of $12.0 million by BPA to the partnership and the grant by the
partnership to BPA of future options to purchase power at Glass Mountain, the partnership and BPA terminated the
MOU and certain ancillary agreements. In addition, BPA will pay the partnership additional consideration should
certain future events occur related to the ongoing environmental review of the Glass Mountain project. Following the
settlement with BPA, TGC withdrew from the partnership.
Of the $12.0 million received by the partnership in December 1996, $4.7 million was allocated to TGC, of which $3.0 million
was received by the Company in payment of a loan (see Note 15). Previously capitalized project costs were charged
to expense, and no significant gain or loss was included in net income for the year 1996.
At December 31, 1996, the Company had $4.0 million of geothermal leases at Glass Mountain recorded as Property,
plant and equipment, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The Company is continuing to pursue the
development of Glass Mountain, and expects to recover the cost of such leases from the future development of the resource.
8. CALPINE VAPOR, INC.
In November 1995, Calpine Vapor entered into agreements with Constructora y Perforadora Latina, S.A. de C.V.
("Coperlasa") and certain Mexican bank lenders to loan funds to Coperiasa in connection with a geothermal steam
production contract at the Cerro Prieto geothermal resource in Baja California, Mexico. The resource currently pro-
duces electricity from geothermal power plants owned and operated by Comision Federal de Electricidad ("CFE").
Mexico's national utility. The steam field contract is between Coperlasa and CFE. Calpine Vapor loaned $18.5 million
to Coperlasa, and received fees for technical services provided to the project. At December 31, 1996, notes receiv-
able (see Note 15) totaled $18.0 million. The Company is deferring the recognition of income on this loan until the
Cerro Prieto project generates sufficient cash flows available for distribution to support the collectibility of interest earned.
In December 1995, Calpine Vapor also paid $1.5 million for an option to purchase an equity interest in Coperlasa. The
option is being amortized over the estimated repayment period of the Coperlasa loan and is included in Other assets.
Calpine Corporation
389. KING CITY TRANSACTION
In April 1996, the Company entered into a long-term operating lease with BAF Energy, A California Limited
Partnership ("BAF"), for a 120 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration power plant located in King City, California.
The power plant generates electricity for sale to PG&E pursuant to a long-term PSA through 2019 and provides steam
to a vegetable processing plant.
The Company makes semi-annual lease payments to BAF on each February 15 and August 15, a portion of which is
supported by a $95.0 million collateral fund owned by the Company. The collateral fund consists of investment grade
and U.S. Treasury Securities that mature serially in amounts equal to a portion of the lease payment. The collateral
fund securities are classified as held-to-maturity investments (see Note 2). As of December 31, 1996, future rent pay-
ments are $24.4 million for 1997, $23.8 million for 1998, $19.4 million for 1999, $20.1 million for 2000, $20.8 million
for 2001, and $183.2 million thereafter. Included in the accompanying December 31, 1996 balance sheet is approx-
imately $12.7 million of unamortized prepaid lease costs.
The Company recorded the value of the above-market pricing provided in the PSA as an asset which is included in
property, plant and equipment. The Company has also recorded a deferred lease incentive of $78.5 million at
December 31, 1996 equal to the value of the above-market payments to be received. The asset and liability are being
amortized over the life of the power sales agreement and lease, respectively.
10. GILROY TRANSACTION
On August 29, 1996, the Company acquired a 120 megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration power plant located in
Gilroy, California. The cost of the Gilroy Power Plant was $125.0 million plus certain contingent consideration, which
is expected to be $24.1 million. The Company recorded the value of the above-market pricing provided in the PSA of
$82.1 million as an asset which is included in Property, plant and equipment.
Electricity generated by the Gilroy Power Plant is sold to PG&E pursuant to a long-term PSA terminating in 2018. The
PSA contains ment provisions for capacity and energy. The Gilroy Power Plant also produces and sells thermal
energy to ConAgra, Inc.

The Company has entered into a development agreement with Phillips Petroleum Company ("Phillips") to construct
and operate a 240 megawatt gas-fired cogeneration project at the Phillips Houston Chemical Complex ("HCC") located
in Pasadena, Texas. In December 1996, the Company entered into an Energy Sales Agreement with Phillips pursuant
to which Phillips will purchase all of HCC's steam and electricity requirements of approximately 90 megawatts. It is
anticipated that the remainder of available electricity output will be sold into the competitive market. Company
provided a $3.0 million letter of credit to Phillips to secure the performance under the project development agree-
ment. The Company also entered into a credit agreement with ING U.S. Capital Corporation to provide $98.6 million
of non-recourse project financing. In accordance with the credit agreement, the Company contributed $53.1 million
in cash to the project, of which the remaining $41.0 million is included in Restricted cash in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet. The Company commenced construction in February 1997, with commercial operation
scheduled to begin in October 1998. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in completing
any additional PSAs or that the anticipated schedule for construction will be met.

lumber drying operation owned by an affiliated individual.
Construction financing was provided through a $95.2 million construction and term loan agreement with The
Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential") and Credit Suisse, an affiliate of the Company. In addition,
ENCO has a $24.8 million loan agreement with Prudential and Credit Suisse. On May 25, 1993, the entire $120.0 million
was converted to a term loan.
In addition, the Company provides operations and maintenance services to Sumas and receives a fixed fee of $1.1 million
per year adjusted annually for inflation, an annual base fee of $150,000 per year also adjusted annually for inflation
and certain other reimbursable expenses. The Company is entitled to an annual performance bonus of up to $400,000
based upon the achievement of certain performance levels. This arrangement will expire upon the date Whatcom
receives its 24.5% pre-tax return or 10 years, subject to renewal terms, whichever is later. The Company recorded
revenue of approximately $2.0 million, $2.0 million, and $1.9 million associated with this arrangement during the years
ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
O.L.S. Energy-Agnews, Inc. The Company has a 20% interest in O.L.S. Energy-Agnews, Inc., a joint venture with GATX
Capital Corporation, which owns and operates a 29 megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle cogeneration facility at the
State-owned Agnews Developmental Center ("Center") in San Jose, California. The cogeneration plant provides the
Center with all of its thermal and electric requirements. Excess electricity is sold to PG&E under a Standard Offer No. 4
contract. The Company's original investment was $1.8 million.
In addition to its interest as stated above, the Company has been contracted by the joint venture to provide operations
and maintenance services at cost plus overhead and fees, as specified. The Company recorded revenue of $2.0 million,
$1.5 million, and $1.4 million associated with this service agreement and for other services provided to the joint venture
for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
Calpine Corporation
42In January 1990, O.L.S Energy-Agnews, Inc. entered into a credit agreement with Credit Suisse providing for a $28.0 million
loan. The loan is secured by all of the assets of the Agnews Power Plant and bears interest on the unpaid principal balance
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin rate varying between 0.05% and 1.5%.
Geothermal Energy Partners, Ltd. During 1989, the Company acquired a 5% interest in Geothermal Energy Partners
Ltd. ("GEP"). GEP was established in 1988 to develop, finance and construct a 20 megawatt geothermal power pro-
duction facility located in The Geysers area of northern California. The facility began operations on June 6, 1989.
In addition to its interest as stated above, the Company has been contracted by GEP to provide operations and mainte-
nance services at cost plus overhead and fees, as specified. The Company recorded revenue of $4.0 million, $3.5 million
and $3.7 million associated with this service agreement to GEP for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively.
The Company accounts for its investment in GEP under the equity method because control of the project is deemed to
be shared under the terms of the partnership agreement, and the Company has significant influence over the operation
of the venture.
15. NOTES RECEIVABLE
In May 1993, in accordance with the Sumas partnership agreement, the Company was entitled to receive a distribution
of $1.5 million and SEI, the Company's partner in Sumas, was required to make a capital contribution of $1.5 million.
In order to meet SEI's $1.5 million capital contribution requirement, the Company loaned $1.5 million to the sole
shareholder of SEI, who in turn loaned the funds to SEI, who in turn contributed the capital to Sumas. The loan bears
interest at 20% and is secured by a security interest in the loan between SEI and its sole shareholder. The Company
will receive payments of 50% of SEI's cash distributions from Sumas. The payments will first reduce any accrued and
unpaid interest and then reduce the principal balance. On May 25, 2003, all unpaid principal and interest is due.
In March 1994, the Company loaned $10.0 million to the sole shareholder of SEI. The loan matures in 10 years and
bears interest at 16.25%. The loan is secured by a pledge to Calpine of SEI's interest in Sumas. In order to provide
for the payment of principal and interest on the loan, an additional 12/2% of the cash flow generated by Sumas was
assigned to Calpine. The Company deferred the recognition of interest income from these notes until Sumas gener-
ated net income. In 1996, the Company recognized a total of $2.1 million of interest income related to the above two
loans, which represents the portion of Sumas' earnings not recognized by Calpine related to its equity investment in Sumas.
In August 1994, the Company entered into a loan agreement providing for loans up to $4.8 million to Trans-Pacific
Geothermal Glass Mountain Ltd. ("TGGM"), a subsidiary of TGC (see Note 7). The loan bore interest at 10% and had
a maturity date which was based on certain future events. The loan was secured by a pledge to Calpine of the partner's
interest in the Glass Mountain project. The Company was deferring the recognition of income from this note until the
Glass Mountain project generated sufficient income to support the collectibility of interest earned. At December 1, 1996,
$4.1 million was outstanding. In December 1996, the Company received $3.0 million from TGGM in payment of the
loan and recorded a $1.1 million loss for uncollectible amounts, which was included in Other income, net (see Note 7).
Calpine Corporation
43As of December 31, 1996, Calpine Vapor had notes receivable of $18.0 million from Coperlasa and associated
unamortized loan acquisition fees of $1.1 million (see Note 8). Interest accrues on the outstanding notes receivable
at approximately 18.9%. The Company is deferring the recognition of income from this note until the Cerro Prieto
project generates sufficient cash flows available for distribution to support the collectibility of interest earned.
16. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND LINES OF CREDIT
At December 31, 1996, the Company had a $50.0 million three-year credit facility available with a consortium of com-
mercial lending institutions which include The Bank of Nova Scotia, International Nederlanden U.S. Capital
Corporation, Sumitomo Bank of California and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. As of December 31, 1996, the
Company had no borrowings and $5.9 million of letters of credit outstanding, which reflect $3.0 million to secure per-

of each interest period for such loans, but not less often than quarterly, based on the principal amount outstanding
during the period for base rate loans, and on the last day of each applicable interest period, but not less often than
90 days, for LIBOR loans. The credit agreement expires in September 1999. The credit agreement specified that the
Company maintain certain covenants with which the Company was in compliance. Commitment fees related to this
line of credit are charged based on 0.50% of committed unused credit.
At December 31, 1995, the Company had a $50.0 million credit facility with Credit Suisse (whose parent company
owns approximately 44.9% of Electrowatt Ltd. ("Electrowatt"), the former indirect sole owner of the Company prior
to the initial public offering on September 25, 1996). At December 31, 1995, the Company had $19.9 million of bor-
rowings outstanding, bearing interest at LIBOR plus 0.5% (6.4% at. December 31, 1995). Interest could be paid at

credit. The aggregate unpaid principal of the working capital loan is payable in full at least once a year, with the final
payment of principal, interest and fees due June 30, 1998. Interest on borrowings accrues at the option of the
Company at either a base rate, LIBOR, or a certificate of deposit rate (plus applicable margins in all cases) over the
term of the loan. No borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 1996 and 1995. The Company had letters of credit
outstanding of $459,000 at December 31, 1996 and 1995. Outstanding letters of credit bear interest at 0.625%

9.93% (see discussion on swap agreement below) with the remainder accruing interest at LIBOR plus an applicable
margin (6.75% and 6.69% at December 31, 1996 and 1995, respectively) over the term of the loan, collateralized by
all of CGC's assets and the Company's interest in CGC. The premium is amortized over the life of the fixed rate portion
of the loan using the interest method.
Calpine Corporation
Junior-Term Loans. Principal and interest are payable in quarterly installments at variable amounts beginning
September 30, 2002 with the final payment of principal, interest and fees due June 30, 2005; interest accrues at

The Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on
a portion of its senior-term loans. These agreements fix the interest on this portion at 9.93%. At December 31, 1996,
the swap agreements applied to debt with a principal balance total of $73.0 million. The interest rate swap agree-
ments mature through December 31, 2000. The premium on debt was recorded in conjunction with the acquisition
as discussed above. The amortization of the premium adjusts the effective interest rate on the fixed-rate debt to
7.05% per annum. The floating interest rate associated with this portion of the senior-term loans was LIBOR plus an
applicable margin (6.63% at December 31, 1996 and 6.99 % at December 31, 1995). The Company is exposed to credit:
risk in the event of non-performance by the other parties to the swap agreements.
Notes Payable to Banks. In September 1994, the Company entered into a two-year agreement with The Bank of Nova
Scotia to finance the acquisition of TPC. In May 1996, a portion of the net proceeds from the Company's issuance of
the 10% Senior Notes Due 2006 was utilized to repay the total $57.0 million of borrowings under this agreement.In June 1995, the Company entered into an agreement with Sumitomo Bank to finance the acquisition of the
Greenleaf Power Plants. Of the $74.7 million debt outstanding at. December 31, 1996, $59.0 million bears interest
fixed at 7.4%, with the remaining floating rate portion accruing interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (6.24%
as of December 31, 1996). At December 31, 1995, $76.0 million of debt was outstanding, of which $60.0 million was
at the fixed interest rate of 7.4%, with the remaining floating rate portion accruing interest at approximately 6.5%.
This debt is secured by all of the assets of Greenleaf 1 and 2. Interest on the floating rate portion may be at
Sumitomo's base rate plus an applicable margin or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Interest on base rate loans is
paid at the end of each calendar quarter, and interest on LIBOR based loans is paid on each maturity date, but not
less often than quarterly, based on the principal amount outstanding during the period. At the Company's discretion,
the LIBOR based loans may be held for various maturity periods of at least 1 month up to 12 months. The $74.7 million
debt will be repaid quarterly, with a final maturity date of December 31, 2010.
On August 29, 1996, the Company entered into an agreement with Banque Nationale de Paris ("BNP") to finance the
acquisition of the Gilroy Power Plant. As of December 31, 1996, BNP had provided a $119.8 million loan consisting
of a 15-year tranche in the amount of $84.8 million and an 18-year tranche in the amount of $35.0 million. In addition,
BNP provided two additional tranches for the payment of certain contingent consideration, which at December 31,
1996 totaled $19.6 million. The debt is secured by all of the assets of the Gilroy Power Plant. A portion of the BNP
notes bears interest fixed at a weighted average of 6.6% (see discussion below), with the remainder accruing interest
at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (6.6% at December 31, 1996). Interest on the floating rate portion may be at
BNP's base rate plus an applicable margin or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin. Interest on base rate loans is
payable not less often than quarterly. Interest on LIBOR based loans is paid on each maturity date, but not less often
than quarterly. At the Company's discretion, LIBOR based loans may be held for various maturity periods of at least
1 month and up to 12 months. The $119.8 million debt will be repaid semi-annually beginning August 31, 1997, with a final
maturity date of August 28, 2011. Commitment fees are charged based on 1% to 1.125% of committed unused credit.
The Company entered into four interest rate swap agreements to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates.
These agreements fix the interest on $87.5 million of principal at a weighted average interest rate of 6.6%. The interest
rate swap agreements mature through August 2011. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-perfor-
mance by the other parties to the swap agreements.

$309,267The carrying value of $73.0 million and $99.4 million of the senior-term loan as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively, has an effective rate of 9.93% under the Company's interest rate swap agreements (7.05% after con-
sideration of the debt premium). Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with
similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the debt as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 is approximately $83.2 million and
$107.3 million, respectively. The carrying value of the remaining $20.0 million of the senior-term and the $20.0 million
junior-term loans and the notes payable to banks approximate the debts' fair market value as the rates are variable
and based on the current LIBOR rate.
The non-recourse debt is held by subsidiaries of Calpine. The debt agreements of the Company's subsidiaries and
other affiliates governing the non-recourse project financing generally restrict their ability to pay dividends, make distri-
butions or otherwise transfer funds to the Company. The dividend restrictions in such agreements generally require
that, prior to the payment of dividends, distributions or other transfers, the subsidiary or other affiliate must provide
for the payment of other obligations, including operating expenses, debt service and reserves.
On December 20, 1996, the Company entered into a credit agreement with ING U.S. Capital Corporation to provide
$98.6 million of non-recourse project financing for the Pasadena Cogeneration Project (see Note 11). No borrowings
were outstanding at December 31, 1996. Interest is payable at ING's base rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus an
applicable margin on the last day of each calendar quarter, or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin upon maturity of
the loan, but no less than quarterly. All interest is due and payable upon conversion of the construction loan to a term
loan. Subject to the terms of the credit agreement, all or part of the construction loan will be converted to a term loan
upon completion of construction. Commitment fees are charged based on 0.375% of committed unused credit.
19. NOTES PAYABLE
At December 31, 1996, the Company had a non-interest bearing promissory note for $6.5 million payable to Natomas
Energy Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxus Energy Company. This note has been discounted to yield 8.0%
per annum, due September 9, 1997. The carrying amount of $6.2 million at December 31, 1996 approximates fair
market value.
In January 1995, the Company purchased the working interest covering certain properties in its geothermal properties
at CGC from Santa Fe Geothermal, Inc. The purchase price included $6.0 million cash, and a $750,000 non-interest
bearing note discounted to yield 9% per annum and due on December 26, 1997. The Company may repay all or any
part of the note at any time without penalty. The carrying value of $686,000 of the discounted non-interest bearing
note at December 31, 1996 approximates fair market value.
20. SENIOR NOTES
On May 16, 1996, the Company issued $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 101/2% Senior Notes Due 2006.
The net proceeds of $174.9 million were used to repay $53.7 million of borrowings under the Credit Suisse Credit
Facility, $57.0 million of non-recourse project financing and $45.0 million of borrowings from The Bank of Nova
Scotia. The remaining $19.2 million was available for general corporate purposes. Transaction costs of $5.1 million
incurred in connection with the public debt offering were recorded as a deferred charge and are amortized over the
ten-year life of the 101/2% Senior Notes Due 2006.
Calpine Corporation
47The 101% Senior Notes Due 2006 will mature on May 15, 2006. The Company has no sinking fund or mandatory
redemption obligations with respect to the 10% Senior Notes Due 2006. Interest is payable semi-annually on May
15 and November 15. Based on the traded yield to maturity, the approximate fair market value of the 10% Senior
Notes Due 2006 was $191.7 million as of December 31, 1996.
On February 17, 1994, the Company completed a $105.0 million public debt offering of 9 14% Senior Notes Due 2004.
Transaction costs of $4.1 million incurred in connection with the public debt offering were recorded as a deferred
charge and are amortized over the ten-year life of the 94% Senior Notes Due 2004.
The 91/4% Senior Notes Due 2004 will mature on February 1, 2004. The Company has no sinking fund or mandatory
redemption obligations with respect to the 9 4% Senior Notes Due 2004. Interest is payable semi-annually on
February 1 and August 1. Based on the traded yield to maturity, the approximate fair market value of the 9 14% Senior
Notes Due 2004 was $105.7 million as of December 31, 1996.
The Senior Note indentures specify that the Company maintain certain covenants with which the Company was in
compliance. The Company may, under certain circumstances, be limited in its ability to make restricted payments, as
defined, which include dividends and certain purchases and investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage
in certain transactions.
21. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES
The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recog-
nized for the tax consequences of "temporary differences" to the extent they are not reduced by net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards by applying enacted statutory rates.
The components of the deferred tax liability as of December 31, 1996 and 1995 are (in thousands):
Expenses deductible in a future period
Net operating loss and credit carryforwards
Other differences
Deferred tax asset, before valuation allowance

The net operating loss and credit carryforwards consist of Federal and State net operating loss carryforwards which
expire 2005 through 2010 and 2000, respectively, and Federal and State alternative minimum tax credit carryfor-
wards which can be carried forward indefinitely. At December 31, 1996, the Federal and State net operating loss
carryforwards were approximately $23.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 1996, the State net
operating losses have been fully reserved for in the valuation allowance due to the limited carryforward period
allowed by the State of California. A1 December 31, 1996, Federal and State alternative minimum tax credit carry-
forwards were approximately $6.7 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
(2,311)
(1,435)
(120,060)
$ (97,621)Realization of the deferred tax assets and federal net operating loss carryforwards is dependent, in part, on generating
sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards. In September 1996, the Company underwent
an ownership change as a result of the initial public offering of the Company's common stock. This ownership change
limits the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards available to offset current tax liabilities. Although
realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized
based on estimates of future taxable income. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could
be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.
In 1996, the Company decreased its deferred income tax liability by $769,000 to reflect the change in California's
state income tax rate from 9.3% 10 8.84% effective January 1, 1997.

1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company adopted 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP") in July 1996. Eligible employees may purchase
up to 275,000 shares of common stock at semi-annual intervals through periodic payroll deductions. Shares are pur-
chased on February 28 and August 31 of each year. On the first purchase date of February 28, 1997, employees pur-
chased 25,819 shares of common stock at a weighted average fair value of $13.60 per share. The purchase price is
85% of the lower of (i) the fair market value of the common stock on the participant's entry date into the offering period,
or (ii) the fair market value on the semi-annual purchase date.
1996 Stock Incentive Plan
The Company adopted the 1996 Stock Incentive Plan ("SIP") in September 1996; such plan succeeded the Company's
previously adopted stock option program. The Company accounts for this plan under APB Opinion No. 25, under
which no compensation cost has been recognized in 1996. Had compensation cost for this plan been determined con-
sistent with SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Company's net income and earning per share
would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts (in thousands, except per share amounts):

$ 0.51Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to options granted prior to January 1, 1995,
the resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.
The Company may grant options for up to 4,041,858 shares under the SIP. As of December 31, 1996, the Company
had granted options to purchase 2,340,294 shares of common stock. Under the SIP, the option exercise price equals
the stock's fair market value on date of grant. The SIP options generally vest after four years and expire after 10 years.
A summary of the status of the Company's SIP at December 31, 1996 and changes during the year then ended is pre-

26. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In January 1995, the Company and Electrowatt entered into a management services agreement whereby Electrowatt
agreed to provide the Company with advisory services in connection with the construction, financing, acquisition and
development of power projects, as well as any other advisory services as may be required by the Company in con-
nection with the operation of the Company. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company paid $166,000 and $200,000
of such management services in 1996 and 1995, respectively. The management services agreement terminated
September 25, 1996, with completion of the initial public offering.During 1996, 1995, and 1994, the Company paid $123,000, $106,000, and $69,000, respectively, to Electrowatt pur-
suant to a guarantee fee agreement whereby Electrowatt agreed to guarantee the payment, when due, of any and all
indebtedness of the Company to Credit Suisse in accordance with the terms and conditions of the line of credit. Under
the guarantee fee agreement, the Company had agreed to pay to Electrowati. an annual fee equal to 1% of the average
outstanding balance of the Company's indebtedness to Credit Suisse during each quarter as compensation for all services
rendered under the guarantee fee agreement. The guarantee fee agreement terminated in September 1996.
At December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately $1.2 million in accounts receivable from Electrowatt. (see
Note 12) related to reimbursement of costs for the sale of Electrowatt's common stock in Calpine. As a result of
Electrowatt's sale of Calpine common shares, Electrowatt no longer owns any interest in Calpine.
27. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS
The Company's electricity and steam sales revenue is primarily from two sources PG&E and SMUD. Revenues
earned from these sources for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 were as follows (in thousands):

28. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Capital Projects. The Company has 1997 commitments for capital expenditures totaling $4.0 million related to various
projects at its geothermal facilities. In March 1996, the Company entered into an energy development agreement with
Phillips Petroleum Company to develop, construct, own and operate a 240 megawatt gas-fired cogeneration facility
at Phillips Houston Chemical Complex in Pasadena, Texas. The Company commenced construction in February 1997,
with commercial operation scheduled to begin in October 1998. The Company has 1997 commitments of $97.2 million
related to this project.
Royalties and Leases. The Company is committed under several geothermal leases and right-of-way, easement and
surface agreements. The geothermal leases generally provide for royalties based on production revenue with reductions
for property taxes paid. The right-of-way, easement and surface agreements are based on flat rates and are not material.
Under the terms of certain geothermal leases, royalties accrue at rates ranging from 7% to 12.5% of steam and effluent
revenue. Certain properties also have net profits and overriding royalty interests ranging from approximately 1.45%
to 28%, which are in addition to the land royalties. Most lease agreements contain clauses providing for minimum
lease payments to lessors if production temporarily ceases or if production falls below a specified level.The Company also has working interest agreements with third parties providing for the sharing of approximately 25%
to 30% of drilling and other well costs, various percentages of other operating costs and 25% to 30% of revenues on
specified wells.
Expenses under these agreements for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994 are (in thousands):
1990
Production royalties $10,793
Lease payments
$ 246

1998
1999
$10,574

1995
Natural Gas Purchases. The Company enters into long-term gas purchase contracts with third parties to supply gas
to its gas-fired cogeneration projects. Such contracts generally have terms of 1 to 24 months, and existing contracts
expire though July 31, 1997, continuing month to month thereafter unless either party terminates the agreement
upon sixty days written notice. On January 31, 1997, the Company purchased MNI which supplies gas to the
Greenleaf Power Plants (see Note 5).
Watsonville Operating Lease. The Company is committed under an operating lease (through December 2009) for a 28.5
megawatt natural gas-fired cogeneration power plant located in Watsonville, California (see Note 5). Under the terms
of the lease, basic and contingent rents are payable each month during the period from July through December. As
of December 31, 1996, future basic rent payments are $2.9 million for each year from 1997 to 2001, and $24.4 million
thereafter through December 2009. Contingent rent payments are based on the net of revenues less all operating
expenses, fees, reserve requirements, basic rent and supplemental rent payments. Of the remaining balance, 60% is
payable to the lessor and 40% is payable to the Company.

Office and Equipment Leases. The Company leases its corporate office, Houston office, Portland office, Santa Rosa office
facilities and certain office equipment under noncancellable operating leases expiring through 2001. Future minimum
lease payments under these leases are (in thousands):
$11,153
$ 252
Calpine Corporation

$1,138

Lease payments are subject to adjustment for the Company's pro rata portion of annual increases or decreases in
building operating costs. In 1996, 1995 and 1994, rent expense for noncancellable operating leases amounted to
$1,036,000, $733,000 and $663,000, respectively.
$4,543Regulation and CPUC Restructuring. Electricity and steam sales agreements with PG&E are regulated by the CPUC. In
December 1995, the CPUC proposed the transition of the electric generation market to a competitive market beginning
January 1, 1998, with all consumers participating by 2003. Since the proposed restructure results in widespread
impact on the market structure and requires participation and oversight of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
("FERC"), the CPUC has sought to build a California consensus involving the legislature, the Governor, public and
municipal utilities and customers. The consensus has resulted in filings with FERC which should permit both the
CPUC and FERC to collectively proceed with implementation of the new competitive market structure. On September
23, 1996, state legislation was passed. AB 1890 (the "Bill"), which codified much of the CPUC decision and directed
the CPUC to proceed with implementation of restructure no later than January 1, 1998. The Bill accelerated the tran-
sition period to a fully competitive market from five years to four years with all consumers participating by the year
2002. The Bill provided for an electricity rate freeze for the period of transition and mandated through issuance of
rate reduction bonds a 10% rate reduction for small commercial and residential customers effective January 1, 1998.
The proposed restructuring provides for phased-in customer choice (direct access), development of a non-discrimi-
natory market structure, full recovery of utility stranded costs, sanctity of existing contracts, and continuation of
existing public policy programs including funds for enhancement of in-state renewable energy technologies during the
transition period. The Company cannot predict the final form or timing of the proposed restructuring and the impact,
if any, that such restructuring would have on the Company's exitsting business or results of operations. The Company
believes that any such restructuring would not have a material effect on its power sales agreements and, accordingly,
believes that its existing business and results of operations would not be materially adversely affected, although there
can be no assurance in this regard.
A domestic electricity generating project must be a QF under FERC regulations in order to take advantage of certain
rate and regulatory incentives provided by the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended ("PURPA").
PURPA exempts owners of QFs from the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended ("PUHCA"), and
exempts QFs from most provisions of the Federal Power Act (the "FPA") and state laws concerning rate or financial
regulation. PURPA also requires that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by QFs at a price based on the
utility's "avoided cost", and that the utility sell back-up power to the QF on a non-discriminatory basis. If one of the
projects in which the Company has an interest should lose its status as a QF the project would no longer be entitled
to the exemptions from PUHCA and the FPA. This could trigger certain rights of termination under the PSA, could
subject the project to rate regulation as a public utility under the FPA and state laws and could result in the Company
inadvertently becoming a public utility holding company. The Company believes that each of the electricity generating projects
in which the Company owns an interest currently meets the requirements under PURPA necessary for QF status.
Litigation. The Company, together with over 100 other parties, was named as a defendant in an action brought in
August 1993 by the bankruptcy trustee for Bonneville Pacific Corporation ("Bonneville"), captioned Roger G. Segal, as
the Chapter 11 Trustee for Bonneville Pacific Corporation v. Portland General Corporation, et al., in the United States District
Court for the District of Utah (the "Court"). In December 1996, the trustee and the Company entered into a settlement
agreement relating to this matter. The trustee has agreed to waive all claims against the Company and to dismiss the
trustee's litigation against the Company in exchange for a payment of $767,500 by the Company.
Calpine Corporation
54The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions arising out of the normal course of business.
Management does not expect that the outcome of these cases will have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.
29. QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED)
The Company's quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future as a
result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and size of acquisitions, the completion of devel-
opment projects, the timing and amount of curtailment, and variations in levels of production. Furthermore, the
majority of capacity payments under certain of the Company's power sales agreements are received during the
months of May through October.
In the first quarter of 1996, the Company issued $50.0 million of preferred stock to Electrowatt (see Note 23).
In the second quarter of 1996, the Company entered into an operating lease for the King City Power Plant (see Note 9)
and issued $180.0 million of 102% Senior Notes Due 2006 (see Note 20).
In the third quarter of 1996, the Company acquired the Gilroy Power Plant (see Note 10) and charged to earnings a
$3.7 million uncollectible amount associated with the attempt to acquire the O'Brien companies (see Note 13). The
Company also incurred an employee bonus expense of $1.4 million related to the initial public offering of common
stock in September 1996, and recorded a $1.8 million loss related to its electricity trading operations. In addition, the
Company decreased its deferred income taxes by $769,000 to reflect the change in California's state income tax rate
from 9.3% to 8.84% effective January 1, 1997.
In the fourth quarter of 1996, the Company recorded a $1.4 million net gain related to the settlement of the Coso
project, offset by a $767,500 expense related to the settlement of certain litigation (see Note 28). In addition, the
Company revised its prior years' tax estimates by $700,000.
The Company's common stock has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange beginning September 19, 1996.
There were approximately 39 common stockholders of record at December 31, 1996. No dividends have been paid to-date.

OF
INDUSTRY
AVAILABILITY - Percent of the total hours in a year a
power plant is available to deliver electrical energy to the grid.
For instance, 99% availability means that all planned and
unplanned outages kept the plant out of service 1% of the year,
or 88 hours. Availability is the most commonly used measure of
a plant's performance.
CALPINE CONSTRUCT - An integrated approach for
managing the engineering, procuring the major equipment and
managing the construction of power projects using non-recourse
project financing. Compared with the traditional turnkey
approach, Calpine Construct reduces project costs, while providing
flexibility for design improvements throughout the engineering
and construction phases.
CAPACITY - The maximum amount of electricity that a
power plant can produce under specified conditions. Capacity is
measured in megawatts.
COGENERATION - Á process used in a power plant using
energy from burning fuel to generate electricity and to provide
heat for industrial processes. Traditional methods require two
separate facilities an industrial steam boiler and a utility
power plant. Cogeneration plants use fuel more efficiently than
other fossil fuel technologies.
COMBINED-CYCLE - A power plant uses mechanical
energy from a gas turbine to drive a generator and heat from the
exhaust of the gas turbine to produce steam, which drives a
steam turbine connected to a second generator. This combined
use increases the efficiency of producing electricity.
DEREGULATION Historically, producers of electric
power were regulated utilities generating and distributing power
in exclusive service territories. As a result of federal and state
legislation, a process of deregulation has been under way in the
U.S. since the late 1970s. This has created opportunities for
independent power producers to generate electricity and sell it to
wholesale customers. As deregulation proceeds, retail customers
will be able to select the power company of their choice. In
California, retail deregulation will begin in January 1998.
EBITDA - Earnings Before Interest, Tuxes, Depreciation and
Amortization. EBITDA is a measure of cash flow.
GAS-FIRED POWER PLANTS - Natural gas has
become the fuel of choice for new power generating facilities in
the U.S. and elsewhere where large supplies exist. Typically,
power from modern gas-fired plants costs less than power from
nuclear, oil or new coal plants. Gas-fired plants have shorter
construction periods, higher availability and lower capital costs.
TERMS
GEOTHERMAL ENERGY - Geothermal energy is a
clean, alternative source of power produced from hot water or
steam that has been heated naturally by the earth. Geothermal
energy is found in areas of the world where heat sources are close
to the surface. Commercially productive geothermal fields exist in
over ten countries, including many Pacific Rim nations.
THE GEYSERS GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE -
Located in north central California near the Napa Valley, The
Geysers is the world's largest producing geothermal resource. The
region produces roughly 1,200 mw-enough electricity to
supply the needs of more than one million households.
INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCER (IPP) -
A non-regulated electricity generating company.
INDUSTRIAL STEAM HOST - The industrial facility
which purchases steam and sometimes electricity from a cogen-
eration facility.
KILOWATT (KW), KILOWATT HOUR (KWH)
A kilowatt (kw) is a unit of electric power equal to 1,000 watts.
A kilowatt hour (kwh) is the work done by one kilowatt acting
for one hour A 100 watt light bulb burning for 1,000 hours
consumes 100 kwh. The retail price for electricity in the U.S. is
about seven to thirteen cents per kwh.
MEGAWATT (MW) A megawatt (mw) is equal to
1,000 kilowatts. Power plants are rated in megawatts. Calpine's
plants range in size from 20 mw to 240 mw. A 100 mw power
plant can generate approximately 875 million kwh per year.
MERCHANT POWER PLANT A power generation
facility that sells electricity directly to the newly competitive
power market without the majority of its output being commit-
ted to long-term power sales agreements. Calpine's 240 mw
Pasadena Power Plant is largely a merchant power plant.

NON-RECOURSE FINANCING An arrangement
used to finance the debt portion of a project in which the lender has
recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the specific project.
T
PG & E Pacific Gas and Electric Company, one of the largest
investor-owned utilities in the United States.
POWER AND STEAM SALES AGREEMENTS -
Calpine's gas-fired and geothermal facilities produce electricity
and steam that is sold to utilities, industrial companies and
government institutions under the terms of long-term power and
steam sales agreements.
POWER TRADING - The process of buying and selling
power as a commodity in the market. Calpine trades power
open
as part of its overall power marketing program.SENIOR STAFF
