SHAREHOLDERS
We have just completed one of the most significant years
in the history of your Company. The work that was accomplished,
the milestones achieved and new directives undertaken have
positioned DPL Inc. for an even greater leadership role in
our industry. The successful completion and commercial oper-
ation of the William H. Zimmer Generating Station will
contribute to our success in providing quality service and
competitive prices throughout the 1990's.
Operationally, Zimmer is unmatched in its achievements
as its 365 MW of power played an essential role in meeting
our customers' energy requirements this past summer. For the
nine months that Zimmer has operated, it has achieved a 91%
availability, far exceeding the industry average, and particu-
larly impressive for a brand new plant. Zimmer is also our
most efficient plant and is contributing significantly to our
goal of being a low cost energy producer. This operational
performance, together with the fact that Zimmer meets all the
requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act, will assist us in pro-
viding cost effective and reliable energy for the economy of
West Central Ohio.
With the start-up of Zimmer Station, we filed for an
increase in electric prices in order to recover our investment
in the plant. This price increase request was our first request
in over eight years. DP&L employees have worked hard to
ensure that the interests of both our shareholders and custom-
ers are treated fairly in this process. Utilizing a negotiating
process established by the Public Utilities Commission of
Ohio, we entered into a settlement to increase electric
revenue $129 million, on a one-time basis, phased in over a
three year period. The settlement incorporates a number of
innovative provisions. It provides for a baseline return on
equity of 13% and outlines a renewed effort by DP&L to con-
tinue to provide energy programs and other demand-side
ONE
ALLEN M. HILL
PETER H. FORSTERmanagement services for our customers. DP&L President Allen Hill was instrumental in this process and set the stage for
the agreement which benefits all the parties involved.
We received final approval from the PUCO for our electric rate case settlement in late January. Although full inclusion
of our investment in Zimmer in rates will not be achieved until 1994, we are confident that your Company can achieve its
operational and financial goals under this settlement. Upon PUCO approval, the initial price increase for electric customers
became effective February 1, 1992, with subsequent increases in January 1993 and 1994.
Also in January, the PUCO approved our settlement to increase steam prices 20% effective February 1, 1992. Our
natural gas settlement, which has been submitted to the PUCO for approval, would provide for a 6% increase in natural gas
prices. In accordance with the settlement, the price increase would not go into effect until March 1, 1992.
Unfortunately, despite all of Zimmer's operational achievements, it was not possible to avoid the impact that regulatory
requirements had on our 1991 financial results. As we've been reporting to you throughout the year, due to the regulatory
delay required by Ohio law in recovering the costs associated with Zimmer, earnings were down as compared to last year. As
of year-end, earnings were $1.73 per share, a reduction from the $2.23 per share earned a year ago. Return on share-
holders' equity is 11.0%. Looking ahead, with the approval of the settlement, we will begin to recover the costs associated
with Zimmer and improve our financial results.
Despite the fact that we will not have Zimmer fully reflected in our prices until 1994, we do expect to see an improve-
ment in our cash flow as the amount of construction expenditures levels off. This positive cash flow position will allow us to
maintain a secure dividend. As you are aware, a year ago the annual dividend rate was increased to $1.62 per share. Future
dividend growth will be dependent, to a great extent, on our financial performance under the settlement provisions. Our
objective, however, is to continue to provide our shareholders with a current meaningful return.
As we head into 1992, we are confident that we have taken the right steps this past year to be successful. Our commit-
ment to high levels of operational performance and price competitiveness will enable us to responsibly meet the needs of
the many constituencies we serve and to work together to improve your Company.

IN REVIEW
At DPL Inc., we recognize and embrace the responsibility we have to our shareholders, customers, community and
employees. Our efforts in successfully addressing the concerns and needs of all we serve have resulted in nationally
recognized utility operations and have contributed to a high quality of life in the communities we serve. With the successful
completion of the William H. Zimmer Generating Station and the collaborative settlement of our electric, gas and steam
rate cases, our 1991 accomplishments are examples of how we balance the creation of shareholder value and quality
customer service.
The William H. Zimmer Generating Station began commercial operation ahead of schedule on March 30, 1991, and
has performed exceptionally well. Zimmer has exceeded all industry efficiency and productivity averages, enabling us
to provide for the ever increasing energy needs of our customers. The conversion of
Zimmer Station involved some of the most technically innovative techniques ever
implemented for an electric power plant. The result is a generating facility that is one of the
cleanest and most efficient coal-fired plants in the nation today.
Systemwide, Dayton Power and Light continues to rank among the best utilities in the nation
in both productivity and efficiency. Combined with the high operational performance
of Zimmer, our 1991 system-wide equivalent availability of 88.9% again ranks among the best
nationally. This productivity measurement, which represents the amount of time our units are avail-
able for maximum performance, is well above the industry average
of 80.2%. Over the past five years, our customers have saved
approximately $110 million due to this high level of performance.
Zimmer Station is also playing a role in continuing our
tradition of efficient management of our fuel resources. As
our most efficient generating unit, Zimmer helped DP&L
achieve a system-wide heat rate of 9,912 Btu/kWh which is
significantly below the industry average of 10,367 Btu/kWh.
Heat rate is a measure of a utility's level of efficiency in con-
verting fuel into electricity, DP&L's power plant efficiencies
in the past five years have contributed to $47 million of
additional savings for our customers.
Responsible operations and utilization of resources
have been key to Dayton Power and Light's solid record of
producing environmentally safe energy. Of the power plants
we operate, all are in compliance with Phase I requirements
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Limited fuel switch-
ing to lower sulfur coal at plants owned in common with
other utilities will be required to meet the 1995 Phase I

SIXrequirements. Beyond the year 2000, additional SO₂ reductions will need to be achieved and we anticipate installing
environmental control equipment at one or two of our commonly-owned generating facilities. The cost of compliance with
the Clean Air Act Amendments is not expected to alter DP&L's competitive position in the region.
To recover the costs associated with the construction of Zimmer Station and earn a return on our investment for
shareholders, in April of 1991, Dayton Power and Light filed a request with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) to increase its electric prices. This request was our first in over eight years.
A settlement between Dayton Power and Light and the parties in the electric rate proceeding was reached in early
November through an "Alternative Dispute Resolution" process initiated and encouraged by the PUCO. This settlement,
approved January 22, 1992, provides the Company with an electric revenue increase
of approximately 6.4% per year to be phased in over the next three years and establishes
a baseline allowed return on equity of 13%. In the event that DP&L's return exceeds
the allowed return by one but not more than two percent, then one half of the excess return
will be used to reduce the cost of demand-side management programs. Any return that
exceeds the allowed return by more than two percent will be entirely credited to these
same programs.
As part of the Agreement, DP&L will substantially expand its customer and demand-
side management programs. Up to $60 million will be spent
over the next four years. This represents the largest commit-
ment of any Ohio utility to preserving our energy resources
and providing customers with the opportunity to manage their
energy costs.
The PUCO also found DP&L's requested 20% increase
in steam prices to be a fair and reasonable resolution of its
steam case. Both electric and steam price increases became
effective on February 1, 1992.
In addition, in early January DP&L and the parties
involved in the natural gas case proceeding entered into a
negotiated settlement providing for a 6% increase in natural
gas rates. Under the terms of the natural gas settlement, we
agreed to delay the price increase until after the winter heat-
ing season ended March 1 to help minimize the price impact
on our customers this year. This settlement has been submit-
ted to the PUCO for approval.

SERVICE AREA.programs for both existing and new business development, over 47,000 new jobs have been created since 1986 and more
than 1,600 companies have participated in our price incentive economic development programs. Additionally, the recent
merger of the Air Force Logistics and Systems Commands at Wright Patterson Air Force Base makes Dayton the undisputed
world center for Air Force research and logistics support. As the largest Air Force base in the free world employing nearly
29,000 people, Wright Patterson is the region's largest employer. The recent merger of AT&T and NCR will also benefit
Dayton's economic base with the presence of a major division of a Fortune 100 company,
While recessionary trends persist throughout the national economy, Dayton's overall business environment has
remained stable. In fact, during 1991, we experienced a moderate increase in sales to business customers despite a slow-
down in the national economy and in many regions of the country. The result of Dayton's
diversified economy has been an unemployment rate lower than the state and national aver-
ages for the past seven years. These positive attributes helped to distinguish Dayton as an
"All American City" in 1991, attesting to its enjoyable and productive living environment.
One good indication of Dayton's stability can be seen by the growth in customer energy
demand which resulted in a new peak electricity usage of 2,730 MW in July 1991. This level
of usage, which would have exceeded our available capacity without Zimmer, provides us
with a reserve margin slightly under our 15% goal. Our plans include adding small, gas-
fired combustion turbines throughout the decade beginning
in 1995. This type of capacity addition is the best strategy
for us. These units can be brought on line quickly, with rela-
tively short construction lead time, plus we have existing sites
available with the necessary transmission resources in place.
In our natural gas business, we have continued to diver-
sify our supply of reliable, competitively priced natural gas.
Since 1984, we have expanded our number of natural gas
suppliers from one to the forty suppliers used today. This,
along with our 1990 acquisition of 339 miles of natural gas
pipeline, has provided us with greater flexibility and opera-
tional control in managing business situations like the July
1991 bankruptcy of Columbia Gas System, one of our major
natural gas suppliers. Furthermore, our aggressive purchasing
and diversified supply options have also reduced the average
price of our natural gas from $5.87 per MCF in 1985 to
$4.39 per MCF in 1991, representing over a 25% price
savings for our customers over the past five years.

....training and development of both current and prospective employees is critical to our success. Hiring the best people and
providing them with the tools necessary to do an exceptional job is one way that Dayton Power and Light is planning for the
future. The opening of our twenty-first customer energy center, in the City of Dayton, will also bring us to new levels of
superior customer service. The new Broadway Service Center will not only help to meet the growing needs of our custom-
ers, but will be a central training center for all customer service employees throughout the Company.
Community involvement is totally integrated into the Company's operations and workforce. Through such programs as
our Volunteer Insulation Program, we have insulated over 13,000 homes for needy families throughout our service territory.
Company employees have also evaluated the energy usage of approximately 43,000 customers through our Personal Energy
Profile Program, instructing them on how to make their homes more energy efficient. These
programs and others help DP&L manage and plan for future customer energy usage.
Performing responsibly is more than just providing West Central Ohio with electric
and gas service though. It is supporting the communities where we work and live. Through
the volunteer efforts and leadership role of our employees, Team DP&L has donated count-
less hours of volunteer work and charity to such organizations as The United Way, Commu-
nity Blood Bank, and the "Great Expectations Project," a year-long Hearst Broadcasting
program DP&L is co-sponsoring with a local bank and television station to enhance the
educational development of local area youth.
Innovation and commitment to quality is an integral
part of our business. The shared vision and commitment of
Team DP&L is the driving force that has brought us through
the difficult times of the current recession, the pending reg-
ulatory proceedings, and the completion of Zimmer Station.
We have worked hard within the regulatory framework
to determine a solution that makes sense for both our
shareholders and customers. Our goal is to continue to oper-
ate our power facilities in a productive and efficient manner
and to offer competitively priced energy products. Our organi-
zation has the flexibility to adapt to changing economic
conditions and is ready to meet the challenges that lie ahead.
Balancing the needs of those we serve is key in allowing us
to anticipate and prepare for changes in our industry, main-
tain quality services, and exceed customer and shareholder
expectations, both today and tomorrow.

DebtFINANCIAL REVIEW
The 1991 earnings are $1.73 per share, compared to earnings
per share of $2.23 in 1990 and $2.18 in 1989. The overall
return on shareholders' equity was 11.0% in 1991 compared to
14.7% in 1990 and 15.2% in 1989.
Total electric revenues increased 7% and sales 5% in
1991. This is primarily attributed to unusually hot spring and
summer weather. In 1990, electric revenues increased 3% with
strong sales to business customers offsetting warm winter
weather.
Gas revenues decreased 2% in 1991. Lower gas cost
rates more than counteracted increased sales of 4%. Gas
revenues decreased 14% and sales decreased 10% in 1990 due
to mild winter temperatures.
The Wm. H. Zimmer Generating Station ("Zimmer") was
completed and placed into service on March 30, 1991. In prior
periods, Zimmer had accounted for essentially all the allowance
for funds used during construction ("AFC"). Once commercial
operation began, the AFC relating to Zimmer stopped. The
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ("PUCO") granted DP&L
the authority to defer interest charges on the Zimmer investment
from its commercial operation date until new prices reflecting
Zimmer take effect. This deferred interest, which was less than
prior year's AFC, and Zimmer operating costs and depreciation
resulted in lower 1991 earnings.
Operating and administrative expenses increased 19% in
1991 primarily as a result of the operating expenses associated
with Zimmer. In 1990, operating and administrative expenses
increased 13% due to higher general expenses and uncollecti-
ble accounts expense. Maintenance expense decreased in 1990

Interest charged to operations increased 30% in 1991 as
a result of Zimmer's commercial operation and the associated
decrease in AFC related to borrowed funds charged to construc-
tion. Income taxes decreased in 1991 from prior years due to
lower pre-tax income and a reduction in the deferred tax provi-
sion for property-related timing differences included in 1990
and 1989 expense.
CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND FINANCING
Construction additions were $117 million, $249 million and
$266 million in 1991, 1990, and 1989, respectively. Construc-
tion additions in 1990 and 1989 largely reflect the construction
activity for Zimmer Station.
For the period 1992 through 1996, total construction
additions are projected to be $537 million. During this same
period, a total of $196 million will be required for maturities
and mandatory redemptions for preferred stock and bonds.
During 1991, total cash provided by operating activities
was $174 million. At year end, cash and temporary investments
were $114 million and short-term borrowings were $85 million.
In 1989, DPL Inc. entered into a revolving credit agree-
ment, renewable through 1996, which allows total borrowings
of $200 million. These funds are available to both DPL Inc.
and its subsidiaries. At year end, DPL Inc. had $40 million
outstanding under the credit agreement. DP&L also has

DP&L had $21 million outstanding under its lines of credit
and $24 million in commercial paper outstanding. Issuance of
additional amounts of first mortgage bonds by DP&L is limited
by provisions of its mortgage. At December 31, 1991, approxi-
mately $513 million of additional bonds could have been
issued. The amounts and timing of future financings will
depend upon market and other conditions, rate increases, levels
of sales and construction plans.
The shareholders of the Company approved a proposal to
implement a three-for-two common stock split effected in the
form of a stock dividend at the April 1990 Annual Meeting.
The proposal increased the number of authorized common
shares of the Company from 60 million to 120 million, changed
the
par value from $7.00 per share to $.01 per share and
authorized the transfer of all amounts over the new par value
from the Company's Stated Capital to Other Paid-in Capital.
The split was paid May 4, 1990.
ISSUES AND FINANCIAL RISKS
As a public utility, DP&L is subject to processes which deter-
mine the rates it charges for energy services. Regulators deter-
mine which costs are eligible for recovery in the rate setting
process and when the recovery will occur. They also establish
the rate of return on utility investments which are valued under
Ohio law based on historical costs.
In April 1991, DP&L filed an electric rate increase
request with the PUCO to recover the costs associated with the
construction of Zimmer, earn a return on DP&L's investment
and recover the current costs of providing electric service to its
customers. DP&L has a 28.1% undivided ownership interest in
Zimmer, with $980 million invested at December 31, 1991.
The electric rate increase request, the first since 1982, was
approximately 25% on a one-time basis. In November 1991,
DP&L and various consumer groups filed with the PUCO an
agreement which settled the issues in the case. The agreement
was approved by the PUCO in January 1992, with new rates
effective February 1, 1992. The agreement provides for a
revenue increase of approximately 19% ($129 million) to be
phased in with annual increases of 6.4%, effective in February
1992, January 1993 and January 1994. Amounts deferred,
including carrying charges, during the phase-in period are
estimated at $49 million in 1992 and $25 million in 1993, net
of income taxes, and will be capitalized. The deferrals will be
recovered over seven years commencing in 1994. The phase-in
plan meets the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 92. In addition, DP&L agreed to under-
take cost-effective demand-side management programs with an
average annual cost of $15 million for the next four years. Of
the $15 million per year, approximately $5 million, increasing
to approximately $8.5 million in 1993, would be reflected addi-
tionally in rates as of the effective date of rates in this rate case.
The remaining expenditures will be eligible for recovery in
future rates, in accordance with existing PUCO rulings. The
agreement established a baseline return on equity of 13%
(subject to upward adjustment) on DP&L until its next rate
case. In the event that DP&L's return exceeds the allowed
return by between one to two percent, then one half of the
excess return will be used to reduce the cost of demand-side
management programs, and any return that exceeds the allowed
return by more than two percent will be entirely credited to
these programs. Another provision of the agreement has the
effect of reducing the amount of net utility investment includi-
ble in future rate filings by an amount which declines from
approximately $150 million in 1992 to no reduction after 1995.
In March 1991, the PUCO granted DP&L the authority
to defer interest charges, net of income tax, on the Zimmer
investment from the commercial in-service date through
January 31, 1992. DP&L had also requested authorization to
defer other Zimmer operating costs and depreciation which
were incurred from the in-service date until new electric rates
took effect. This request was denied. Deferred interest charges
in 1991 were $43 million.
In addition to the electric price increase request, DP&L
filed requests to increase natural gas prices by 8% and steam
prices by 20%. In January 1992, DP&L, the Ohio Office of
Consumer Counsel and the PUCO Staff filed with the PUCO an
agreement which settled the issues in the natural gas case. The
agreement provides for a revenue increase of 6.2% ($13.7 million)
effective March 1, 1992. PUCO approval is pending. DP&L
also reached an agreement with the PUCO Staff in the steam
case for $1.4 million, the full amount requested, effective
February 1, 1992. The agreement was approved by the PUCO
in January 1992.
DP&L and numerous other parties have been notified by
the Federal Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") that it
considers them Potentially Responsible Parties for clean-up at
two hazardous waste sites in Ohio. The EPA has estimated clean
up costs of $27.1 million at one site and has not developed an
estimate concerning the remaining site. The final resolution of
these investigations will not have a material effect on DP&L's
financial position.
Changing environmental regulations continue to increase
the cost of providing service in the utility industry. The Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Act") limit sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide emissions nationwide. The Act will restrict
emissions in two phases with Phase I compliance completed by
1995 and Phase II completed by 2000. Final regulations are
expected to be issued by the EPA in 1992.
DP&L's preliminary compliance plan is expected to be
filed with the PUCO with the 1992 Integrated Resource Plan.
DP&L anticipates meeting the requirements of Phase I by using
lower sulfur coal at certain electric generating facilities. In
addition, compliance with the stricter emission limits of
Phase II may require the installation of pollution control equip-
ment at several commonly-owned generating facilities. Total
costs to comply with the Act are dependent on final EPA rules
and the completion of a compliance plan for commonly-owned
generating facilities, to be developed in conjunction with The
Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company and Columbus Southern
Power Company, and cannot be estimated at this time. DP&L
anticipates that costs to comply with the Act will be eligible
for recovery in future fuel hearings and other regulatory
proceedings.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation
The accounts of DPL Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial state-
ments. The consolidated financial statements of DPL Inc. prin-
cipally reflect the results of operations and financial condition
of DPL Inc.'s public utility subsidiary, The Dayton Power and
Light Company (“DP&L”). DP&L is a public utility engaged in
the business of selling electric energy, natural gas and steam.
The results of operations of DPL Inc.'s non-utility subsidiaries
currently do not have a material financial impact on the consoli-
dated results.
Revenues and Fuel
Revenues include amounts receivable from customers through
fuel and gas recovery clauses, which are adjusted periodically
for changes in such costs. Related costs that are recoverable or
refundable in future periods are deferred along with the related
income tax effects. Also included in revenues are amounts
receivable from customers through a surcharge for recovery of
arrearages from certain eligible low-income households.
DP&L records revenue for services provided but not yet
billed to more closely match revenues with expenses. "Accounts
Receivable" on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes un-
billed revenue of (in millions) $35.5 in 1991 and $31,4 in 1990.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction ("AFC")
AFC represents the cost of capital funds (equity and debt) used
to finance construction projects. This cost is included in con-
struction work in progress along with other construction costs.
AFC was capitalized on the Zimmer project through the
March 30, 1991 commercial in-service date. The
rates used by DP&L in 1991, 1990 and 1989 were 10.3%,
10.8% and 10.5%, respectively, net of income taxes. These
rates are compounded semi-annually.
average
Interest charged to operations (shown on the Consolidated
Statement of Results of Operations) consists of interest costs of
(in millions) $93.9 in 1991, $91.6 in 1990 and $91.9 in 1989
less AFC related to borrowed funds of (in millions) $7.1, $24.6
and $22.4 charged to construction in the respective years.
AFC
Property and Plant, Maintenance and Depreciation
Property and plant is shown at its original cost. When a unit of
property is retired, the original cost of that property plus the
cost of removal less any salvage value is charged to accumu-
lated depreciation. Maintenance costs and replacements of
minor items of property are charged to expense.
Depreciation expense is calculated using the straight-line
method, which depreciates the cost of property over its esti-
mated useful life, at annual rates which approximate 3.4% for
1991 and 3.2% for 1990 and 1989.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes are provided for transactions which affect
book net income and taxable income in different accounting
periods except where regulatory policy restricts the deferral
method. Investment tax credit, which reduces taxes currently
payable, is deferred and amortized over the lives of the related
property.
Provisions for deferred income taxes associated with
property and plant reflect consumption of part of the value of
the plant and equipment to which they relate. Consequently,
the related accumulated deferred income taxes are similar to
the accumulated provision for depreciation and are deducted
as a valuation reserve from plant investment in determining the
rate base for ratemaking purposes.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has
issued a Statement and Exposure Draft prescribing changes in
the accounting for income taxes beginning in 1993. Although
adopting these changes may result in a significant increase in
assets and liabilities, the Company does not expect a material
effect on earnings.
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
The temporary cash investments presented on this Statement
consist of liquid investments with a maturity of three months or
less.
Reclassifications
Reclassifications have been made in certain prior years'
amounts to conform to the current reporting presentation.
TWENTY2. RATE MATTERS
A. Electric
In April 1991, DP&L filed an electric rate increase request
with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ("PUCO"), to
recover the costs associated with the construction of the
Wm. H. Zimmer Generating Station ("Zimmer"), earn a return
on DP&L's investment and recover the current costs of providing
electric service to its customers. DP&L has a 28.1% undivided
ownership interest in Zimmer, which was placed in commercial
operation on March 30, 1991. The electric rate increase
request, the first since 1982, was approximately 25% on a
one-time basis. In November 1991, DP&L and various con-
sumer groups filed with the PUCO an agreement which settled
the issues in the case. The agreement was approved by
the PUCO in January 1992, with new rates effective
February 1, 1992. The agreement provides for a revenue
increase of approximately 19% ($129 million) to be phased in
with annual increases of 6.4% effective in February 1992,
January 1993 and January 1994. Amounts deferred, including
carrying charges, during the phase-in period will be
capitalized. The deferrals will be recovered over seven years
commencing in 1994. The phase-in plan meets the require-
ments of FASB Statement No. 92. The agreement established a
baseline return on equity of 13% (subject to upward adjust-
ment) until the next rate case. In addition, DP&L agreed to
undertake cost-effective demand-side management programs
with an average annual cost of $15 million for the next four
3. NOTES PAYABLE AND COMPENSATING BALANCES
DPL Inc. and its subsidiaries have $200 million available
through a revolving credit agreement. This agreement with a
consortium of banks is renewable through 1996. Commitment
fees are approximately $300,000 per year, depending upon the
aggregate unused balance of the loan.
At December 31, 1991, DPL Inc. had $40.0 million
outstanding under this credit agreement at a weighted average
interest rate of 5.50%.
years. Of the $15 million per year, approximately $5 million,
increasing to approximately $8.5 million in 1993, would be
reflected additionally in rates as of the effective date of rates in
this rate case. The remaining expenditures will be eligible for
recovery in future rates in accordance with existing PUCO
rulings.
In March 1991, the PUCO granted DP&L the authority
to defer interest charges, net of income tax, on the Zimmer
investment from the commercial in-service date through
January 31, 1992. DP&L had also requested authorization to
defer other Zimmer operating costs and depreciation which
were incurred from the in-service date until new electric rates
took effect. This request was denied.
B. Natural Gas and Steam
In April 1991, DP&L also filed requests to increase natural
prices by 8% and steam prices by 20%. In January 1992,
DP&L, the Ohio Office of Consumer Counsel and the PUCO
Staff filed with the PUCO an agreement which settled the issues
in the natural gas case. The agreement provides for a revenue
increase of 6.2% ($13.7 million) effective March 1, 1992.
PUCO approval is pending.
DP&L also reached agreement with the PUCO Staff in
the steam case for $1.4 million, the full amount requested,
effective February 1, 1992. The agreement was approved by the
PUCO in January 1992.

DP&L also has $97.1 million available in short-term
informal lines of credit. To support these lines of credit, DP&L
is required to maintain average daily compensating balances of
approximately $700,000 and also pay $189,000 per year in fee
compensation.
At year-end, DP&L had $21.0 million outstanding from
these lines of credit at a weighted average interest rate of 5.21%
and $23.5 million in commercial paper outstanding at a
weighted average interest rate of 5.29%.

gt4. CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS
Changing environmental regulations continue to increase the
cost of providing service in the utility industry. The Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 (the "Act") limit sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emissions nationwide. The Act will restrict emis-
sions in two phases with Phase I compliance completed by
1995 and Phase II completed by 2000. Final regulations are
expected to be issued by the Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") in 1992.
DP&L's preliminary compliance plan is expected to be
filed with the PUCO with the 1992 Integrated Resource Plan.
DP&L anticipates meeting the requirements of Phase I by using
lower sulfur coal at certain electric generating facilities.

In addition, compliance with the stricter emission limits
of Phase II may require the installation of pollution control
equipment at several commonly-owned generating facilities.
Total costs to comply with the Act are dependent on final EPA
rules and the completion of a compliance plan for commonly-
owned generating facilities, to be developed in conjunction
with The Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company and Columbus
Southern Power Company, and cannot be estimated at this time.
DP&L anticipates that costs to comply with the Act will be
eligible for recovery in future fuel hearings and other regulatory
proceedings.

$62.56. PENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
A. Pensions
Substantially all DP&L employees participate in pension plans
paid for by the Company. Employee benefits are based on their
years of service, age at retirement and for salaried employees,
their compensation. The plans are funded in amounts actua-
rially determined to provide for these benefits.
The following table presents the components of pension cost (portions of which were capitalized):
$ in millions
Service cost-benefits earned during the year
Interest cost on projected benefit obligations
Amortization of transition amount
Amortization of prior service cost
Amortization of net (gain) or loss
Expected return on plan assets at 7.5% for 1991, 8% for 1990
and 7% for 1989
Net pension cost for the year
The following table sets forth the plans' funded status at December 31:
$ in millions
Plan assets at fair value invested in guaranteed investment contracts,
equities and fixed income investments

Actuarial present value of projected benefit obligation
Plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligation
Vested benefit obligation
$ in millions
Plan assets in excess of projected benefit obligation
Transitional adjustments not reflected on the Consolidated
Balance Sheet:
Interest rates of 6.75% and 7.5% were used in 1991 and 1990,
respectively, in developing the amounts in the following tables.
Actual returns on plan assets for 1991 and 1990, respectively,
were 13.1% and 6.8%. Increases in compensation levels
approximating 5% were used for all years.
Unamortized transition amount arising from change in
accounting principle
Prior service cost from plan amendments
Changes in plan assumptions and actuarial gains and losses
Net pension assets, December 31
B. Postretirement Benefits
Qualified employees who retired prior to 1987 and their depend-
ents are eligible for health care and life insurance benefits.
DP&L is accruing this unfunded actuarially calculated lia-
bility over the average remaining life of the participants. At
December 31, 1991, $26.5 million of the total $56 million lia-
bility had been accrued. Health and life insurance benefits
expensed were (in millions) $9.5 in 1991, $10.1 in 1990 and

salary increases)

DPL Inc. had 1,885,032 and 154,671 authorized but unissued
shares reserved for the dividend reinvestment and employee
stock plans, respectively, at December 31, 1991. These plans
provide that either original issue shares or shares purchased on
the open market may be used to satisfy plan requirements. In
1991, stock market purchases were used to satisfy the require-
ments of the Company's stock plans.
In 1991, DPL Inc. adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan
pursuant to which one right is presently attached to and trades
with each outstanding DPL Inc. Common Share. The Rights
will separate from the Common Shares and become exercisable
when a person or group acquires or makes a tender offer to
acquire 15% or more of DPL Inc.'s Common Shares. When a
Right becomes exercisable, it entitles the holder to purchase

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of DPL Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of results of operations and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of DPL Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1991 and
1990, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1991, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.
