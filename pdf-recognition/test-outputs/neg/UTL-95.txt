The buzz about increasing
competition in our industry goes
on unabated. To continue grow-
ing in the right direction, Unitil
has developed a strategic plan
that ties together many of the el-
ements of a restructured indus-
try dominated by customer
choice.
day the Unitil System
serves just over 1% of the mar-
ket for electricity in the six-state
New England region. From the
perspective of emerging oppor-
tunities in our region, we see the
New England energy market of-
fering prospects for significant
new growth.
Unitil has a uniquely suc-
cessful history of maximizing op-
portunity and minimizing risk,
while at the same time produc-
ing consistently high levels of
shareholder benefits. We be-
lieve this is the formula for suc-
cess in a competitive market.

Approach
The combined electrical re-
source portfolio of the Unitil Sys-
tem is comprised of a variety of
generation sources, including
owned generation, utility pur-
chased power contracts and pur-
chases from non-utility genera-
tors. Our portfolio approach has
allowed us to seek out the best
wholesale terms and prices,
while at the same time, retaining
the flexibility to realign our re-
sources quickly in response to a
changing market. In both our
electric and gas operations,
Unitil has been optimizing the
benefits of a market-based ap-
proach to energy supply by pur-
suing extensive solicitation, bid-
ding and negotiation programs.

Among the factors that pro-

on a single power source. In fact,
we purchase power from many
types of power generators —
large and small, oil-fired, coal,
nuclear, wood, hydro and natu-
ral gas.
Long-term contracts also pro-
vide stability, while shorter-term
contracts allow for responsive-
ness to changes in market condi-
tions. Multiple sources assure
minimal impact from the unpre-

To Our
Shareholders
t is a pleasure to give you this year's report on the results of the op-
erations of your company. "Growth" seems to be the key word which
best characterizes the environment surrounding the Unitil System of com-
panies. Growth in energy sales, earnings and competitiveness are arising out
of the development of new ideas and the exploitation of new opportunities. The end re-
sult of this growth this past year was an increase of over 38% in the value of your in-
vestment in Unitil the highest among electric utilities in New England.
Another
Looking back over the last year, 1995 shows itself as
Successful Year
a good year for Unitil on many levels. Our manage-
ment reorganization took hold, as we added new people who have given us added ca-
pability and depth. With the intent of strengthening our infrastructure and increasing
productivity, we are implementing new state-of-the-art operating systems and have ac-
complished major upgrades in desktop hardware across the System and network serv-
ers in each of our operating locations, and even ended the year with a seamless main-
frame computer upgrade.
As we invested in our infrastructure, 1995 produc higher earnings and lower
costs to our customers yet again for the third consecutive year. Our strong competitive
position helped produce a growth rate in sales that was over five times greater than the
New England regional average.The Year
The new year provides continued opportunity and challenge, as
Ahead
the states in our region further develop competitive models for the
restructuring of the electric utility industry. In New
Hampshire, for example, a pilot program which
will provide choice of supplier to 3% of the state's
electric customers is being prepared for implemen-
tation, and legislation is under active consider-
ation to ultimately provide choice to all New
Hampshire customers. We have supported, and
will continue to actively support, these efforts.
Managing and delivering competitively
priced, market-based energy supplies to our cus-
tomers for over a decade has put us "ahead of the
curve" in our industry and allowed us to pioneer
innovative growth products such as Energy Bank™
The Energy BankTM promotes economic development in our service areas by providing
power to new and expanding industries at prices which are up to 40% less than the
current New England average industrial rate. Energy BankTM has recently been ap-
proved in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and we have already added sub-
stantial new load for the coming year under this program.
We are investing some of the earnings from this new growth in the development
of additional products designed to secure and expand our market share. This next gen-
eration of product will be designed to provide universal service across all classes of cus-
tomers and will be introduced as competitive opportunities arise from the industry re-
structuring efforts currently underway. As we move into new markets for our products,
we believe that growth in ideas, people and infrastructure will lead to continued growth
in earnings and returns to you, our shareholders.

Building Value
Through Growth
here is plenty of fertile ground in New England - lots of room
to grow. The much anticipated era of deregulation in the retail
electric industry has arrived. With it has come a radically new busi-
ness environment and, for the
first time in the history of our industry, oppor-
tunities for growth outside the regulated
franchise. For some, changes of this sort have
begun sooner than expected; these compa-
nies may not be able to respond to the
opportunities. For others, it brings a wealth
of new prospects. Unitil is well prepared, strongly positioned and moving ahead in
the execution of an aggressive strategy for growth.
Occupying the geographic center of the six-state New England region, the Unitil
System is in a good place to provide energy and energy services to a widening market.
As opportunities arise, we will grow ... because what we do, we
do very well. Unitil has a track record, both long-term and consis-
tent, of offering reliable energy services at prices that are among
the lowest in our region. The System's operating companies
have cut their average prices to consumers in each of the last
three years and we expect to do it again in 1996. But even
with some of the lowest prices in New England, our sales
base, revenues, net income and earnings are all growing and our annual rate of re-
turn to shareholders has consistently outpaced both our New England utility peergroup and the stock market average for our industry. Furthermore, in keeping with
our historically sound financial management practices, we have a healthy ratio of earn-
ings to dividends and a solid capital structure to support our growth.
This is only the be-
ginning. We will grow be-
cause we are proven ex-
perts in the acquisition of
energy and its retail distri-
bution. Our power sup-
ply, acquired in a broad,
competitive energy mar-
ket, is diverse, flexible,
well-balanced, responsive Federal Courth
and secure. Our customer mix is diversified and stable. Innovative price initiatives are in
place that are attracting new industrial customers and supporting existing customers in
their expansion efforts. And unique to these initiatives, they are designed to benefit, not
just the large users, but all the System's customers, by providing economic develop-
ment in their communities and price stability on their own electric bills.
These are the powerful ingredients for growth that are at work today.
Tomorrow's opportunities are already opening, so that we can do more of the same in
new markets all around us.
Building Value Through the Strengths Unitil is in the business
of Our Energy Distribution Business of providing reliable
energy services at the lowest possible cost. As we succeed in this objective, we will
add to our customer base. During 1995, while the average growth rate of all other
investor-owned electric utilities in our region was a lackluster 0.6 percent, sales
growth of Unitil's core customer base led the region at a relatively robust 3.2 per-
cent. Moreover, Unitil's rate of growth has consistently exceeded the average for
New England. We believe this growth is, in part, a product of our ability to keep our
prices low.

ⒸUnitil00
Throughout our lengthy history, we have provided reliable energy services to
diverse and dynamic regions. In New Hampshire, we serve the state's capitol city and
a dozen surrounding communities - some 240 square miles of
the Merrimack River Valley. This is where our growth begins
in core business segments such as this one in the center of New
Hampshire. At the confluence of six major state and interstate
highways, it is a mix of state and federal government facilities;
expanding professional, commercial and manufacturing cen-
ters; and vibrant residential communities. Recent growth in this
region includes a new federal courthouse complex, now near-
ing completion, and the sprawling campus of New Hampshire
State Hospital, which is being renovated and jointly used as state office space. A grow-
ing population has also led to expansions and new construction in both elementary
and secondary school facilities throughout the area.
In the southeastern part of New Hampshire, the Unitil System serves a major
segment of the seacoast region. It includes all or part of 16 communities, several shar-
ing their southern border with Massa-
chusetts. This diverse service territory
occupies about 170 square miles and
includes growing commercial and indus-
trial zones; bustling seasonal resort
communities; and historic, well-rooted,
year-round residential neighborhoods.
Signs of economic growth abound. More and more customers are coming on line.
both private residences and worldwide industry and the commerce that serves them
both. A good place to live and a good place to visit, this service area offers easy access
via three major highways to the Greater Boston metropolitan area and the many recre-
ational sites of New England.
In Massachusetts we provide both electricity and natural gas to a 170-square-
mile area of the Nashua River valley in the north-central part of the state. This is a re-
gion whose manufacturing heritage is known around the world. Proximity to large com-
New Hampshire State Hospitalmercial markets and prime transportation networks, as well as the availability of a skilled
most attractive to
labor force, make it one of the fastest-growing regions of the state
industry. As the area's strong, diversified
economic base reflects the health of its com-
merce and industry, housing starts are once
again rebounding. Still more industrial and
commercial construction is flowing into this
area, recently rated 25th of the top 300
places to live in the United States.
Such fundamental growth gives wit-
ness to the effectiveness of Unitil's energy
pricing, distribution management and pro-
fessional services. In every instance, whether
government, residential, industrial or com-
mercial, our customers drive our business. In
striving to meet the special needs of each
customer group, we have succeeded in main-
taining the balance between keeping energy affordable and making certain it is avail-
able when and where it is needed.
But beyond the ability to deliver dependable services at low prices to a diverse
customer base, the ultimate strength of our Company is being "easy to do business with."
We will build on that strength. In 1996, we will bring into service
a new, comprehensive customer information system that will
speed up access to customer data, simplify work order manage-
ment and enhance on-line services to customers. It will improve
the way we deliver existing services; will easily accommodate
new business services; and will employ technologies for growth,
such as relational database design, linkage to corporate systems,
tracking of customer contacts and global access to data. When customers have a
choice, they will choose the supplier that best meets their needs. We believe that good
service is the only way to establish and maintain customer confidence and loyalty.

Growing Through
Although it is only the beginning of new,
Innovative Services
competitive opportunities for growth, these
opportunities are in fact emerging. Accordingly, the Unitil System is designing its
services and pricing its products to be the supplier of choice. We are actively in-
volved with regulators and legislators to promote concepts of choice for all custom-
ers, and we are working with customers to provide service packages tailored to
their special needs. In doing so, we have attracted new customers and helped open
the door to whole new competitive markets. In the coming years, we will focus in-
creased attention on these emerging growth markets, applying the same principles
here that have already proven highly successful in our other operations.
Unitil's Energy BankTM initiative is one step in that direction. Among the new-
est of the Company's pioneering products, Energy BankTM is directed towards new
or expanding industrial customers who are creating jobs
and making long-term productive investments in our
local communities. Through Energy BankTM, eligible cus-
tomers can receive both market-priced electricity and
hour-by-hour billing at an average price of about 5¢ a
kilowatt-hour. Equal in price to the national average
industrial rate, this product meets the special require-
ments of large power users. Furthermore, its benefits
extend to all System customers through increased local
economic development; reductions in their power costs;
and Power Dividend credits, issued once a year to each of our customers.
Unitil is the only energy services company in our region to make 5¢ power
available to industrial customers on a universal basis. Re atory approval of the
Energy Bank™
program is now secured, and the way is open in both Massachusetts
and New Hampshire for the Unitil System to advance this groundbreaking product
to the marketplace.
Already the Energy Bank™ pricing concept has been applied to both new and
existing customers. For example, Unitil has begun providing energy under this con-
cept to Optima Corporation, a long-term Massachusetts-based industrial customer.:

The innovative rate makes it possible for Optima to remain competitive in its opera-
tions, and also to expand its service, effectively doubling its existing electric load.
Massachusetts Recycling Associates (MRA) is a new customer that will also be re-
ceiving power based on Energy BankTM pricing. This state-of-the-art paper recycling
complex will come on line early this year with a new 17 megawatt load at market-
driven prices. Unique to the agreement with this customer is not only the special price
structure, but also the fact that MRA cogenerates a portion of its own power, which we
then ship across our wires to the plant a cooperative approach with manifest effi-
ciency and environmental benefit.

In New Markets
electric utility industry in New En-
gland is taking on a new look. With the belief that competition will lead to lower
prices, consumers are calling for change. Government and industry leaders more

nity for growth in new markets that are beginning to emerge. Already a low-price

Earnings and Dividends
Unitil's earnings were $1.88 per common
share for the year ending December 31, 1995,
an increase over 1994's record earnings per
share of $1.83 and 1993's record earnings
per share of $1.75. The
average return on com-
mon equity in 1995 was
13.1%. 1995's earnings
performance primarily
reflects increased elec-
tric base revenue from
higher energy sales by
Unitil's retail operating
companies, as well as
the continued ability to
effectively manage and
control the System's op-

Year In Review
The System's total electric base revenue was
up by 2.5% in 1995, due to an overall increase in
kilowatt-hour sales and kilowatt billing demands
of 3.2% and 4.4%, respectively. This increase was
mainly due to continuing growth in the demand
for energy by the System's largest industrial and
commercial customers. In 1995, kilowatt-hour
sales grew by 7.9% to this group of customers. In
addition, extreme seasonal weather patterns in
1995 also played a significant role in sales to the
more weather-sensitive residential and commer-
cial customer groups. In the third quarter, electric
sales used for cooling purposes were supported
by one of the hottest third quarters on record in
New England. In contrast, there was a significant
decline in weather-sensitive energy sales in the
first quarter of the year, during one of the mildest
heating seasons in 30 years. The weather in this
quarter, as measured by heating degree days,
was 16% warmer than the same period last year.
As a result, electric kilowatt-hour sales to residen-
tial customers, whose usage was impacted most
by the mild first quarter, remained relatively un-
changed from the prior year.

sales in each of the last three years by customer

1995 also had a negative impact on gas sales
for the year. In 1995, gas base revenue de-
creased by 3.3%, due to lower gas firm
therm sales compared to the prior year. The
bulk of the decrease in firm therm sales was
caused by a decrease of more than 6% in
sales to residential customers, reflecting the

With more normal winter weather,
growth of both electric and gas sales in the
first quarter of 1996 should show marked im-
provement over 1995. In addition, electric
energy sales to industrial and commercial
customers are also expected to continue to
increase in 1996, as new businesses look to
Unitil for their energy services and existing
customers expand their operations.
In particular, the Company will be aggres-
sively marketing its Energy Bank™ program
throughout 1996. Energy Bank™ is an innova-
tive economic development program de-
signed to bring low-cost energy to new and
expanding industrial customers. With rates in
the range of 5¢/KWH, this program offers
electric energy at a price that is equal to the
National Average industrial rate and is 40%
below the current average industrial rate in
New England.
The System's operations-related costs
(not including fuel, purchased power and
conservation program costs, which are nor-
mally recovered from customers through pe-
riodic cost recovery adjustment mechanisms)
were relatively unchanged in 1995 compared
to 1994, reflecting the continued success of
the Company's disciplined approach to cost
management practices and procedures. Local
property taxes increased 13.2% in 1995,
compared to prior year levels, mainly reflect-
ing annual property tax increases on utility
property.

Electric Operating Revenue increased by ap-
proximately $4.0 million, or 3%, in 1995 com-
pared to 1994. Total electric operating revenue is
comprised of electric base revenue, fuel and pur-
chased power revenue, and conservation and
load management program revenue. Fuel and
purchased power revenue is collected from cus-
tomers through the operation of periodic cost re-
covery adjustment mechanisms. Changes in this
component of operating revenue do not affect
net income, as they normally mirror correspond-
ing changes in fuel and purchased power costs.
Conservation and load management program
revenue is also collected from customers through
periodic cost recovery mechanisms, reflecting un-
derlying changes in conservation and load man-
agement program costs. Electric base revenue is
that portion of electric operating revenue that
has a direct impact on net income. In 1995, elec-
tric base revenue rose by approximately $1.0 mil-
lion. This 2.5% increase in electric base revenue
was due to the continued growth in the System's
electric energy sales to its customers.
In 1994, the System's electric operating rev-
enue increased by approximately $1.3 million, or
1%, with the electric base revenue portion in-
creasing by approximately 2.2%. This increase in
electric base revenue in 1994 compared to 1993,
was due to the growth in the System's total elec-
tric kilowatt-hour sales and kilowatt billing de-
mands of 4.2% and 3.3%, respectively. Partially
offsetting this comparative year-over-year in-
crease in electric base revenue was the full-year
impact of a voluntary base rate reduction that
15
Unitil16
was implemented by the Company's Massachusetts
retail operating subsidiary in December 1993.
ⒸUnitil
Gas Operating Revenue decreased by about
$1.1 million, or 5.7%, in 1995 compared to 1994.
Gas operating revenue is comprised of three com-
ponents: cost of gas revenue, interruptible revenue
and gas base revenue. Cost of gas revenue is col-
lected from customers through the operation of a
cost of gas adjustment mechanism. Changes in this
component of gas operating revenue do not affect
net income as they reflect corresponding changes in
gas supply costs. Interruptible revenue increased
by about $900,000, an increase of more than
64%, due to very favorable spot market prices for
gas in 1995. Margins
earned on interruptible
gas sales are used to
lower rates to firm cus-
tomers directly through
the cost of gas adjust-
ment mechanism, and
do not directly impact
the Company's net in-
come. Gas base rev-
enue is that portion of
gas operating revenue
that has a direct impact on net income. In 1995, gas
base revenue decreased approximately $243,000,
based on an overall decrease of 3.3% in firm therm
sales, due to an extremely mild heating season.

In 1994, total gas operating revenue increased
by about $200,000, or 1%, as compared to 1993. In-
terruptible revenue increased more than 29%, re-
flecting an improvement in the competitive pricing
of gas, a fuel choice for duel-fuel interruptible cus-
tomers in 1994, as compared to 1993. Gas base rev-
enue increased slightly in 1994, due to an increase
of 1.3% in therm sales to firm customers. Partially off-
setting this comparative year-over-year increase in
gas base revenue was a full year of impact of a vol-
untary base-rate reduction that was implemented by
the Company's Massachusetts retail operating sub-
sidiary in December 1993.
Other Revenue of $940,954 in 1995 and
$624,560 in 1994 was principally derived from Unitil
Resources, the Company's energy consulting subsid-
iary, which began providing consulting services to
non-affiliate companies in mid-1993. These consult-
ing services have chiefly related to the provision of
administrative, management and power brokering
services. One of Unitil Resource's principal custom-
ers terminated its service agreement with the Com-
pany as of December 31, 1995, which will reduce
Unitil Resource's contributions to earnings in 1996,
unless new agreements are entered into to replace
the revenue that was billed under this former agree-
ment.
Operating Expenses
crease
Fuel and Purchased Power reflects the cost
of fuel used in electric generation and whole-
sale energy and capacity purchased to meet
the Unitil System's electric energy require-
ments. Fuel and purchased power expenses
(normally recoverable from customers through
periodic cost recovery adjustment mecha-
nisms) increased $2.0 million, or 2.2% in 1995
compared to 1994. The change reflects an in-
System's total energy require-
ments in 1995, partially offset by a reduction in
the average unit cost of the System's power
supply portfolio. Power supply markets contin-
ued to be very competitive in 1995, providing
many opportunities to achieve cost savings
through active participation in the market and
management of the System's resource portfo-
lio. The combined resource portfolio of the
Unitil System is comprised of a variety of
power supply sources, including owned gen-
ration, utility-purchased power contracts and
purchases from non-utility generators. The
Unitil System's total energy supply resources
for 1995 were comprised of: 16% from subsid-
iary-owned generation; 61% from various util-
ity-purchased power contracts; 23% represent-
ing purchases from non-utility generation units.
In 1994 compared to 1993, fuel and pur-
chased power expenses were relatively un-
changed, reflecting favorable pricing of existing
long-term power supply commitments and
competitive short-term power supply markets.
Purchased Gas reflects gas purchased and
made to supply the System's total gas energy
requirements. Purchased Gas decreased by ap-
proximately $617,000, or 5.5%, in 1995 as
compared to 1994. Significant decreases in gas
prices due to favorable gas supply markets
more than offset the 10.5% increase in therms
purchased (including gas purchased for inter-
ruptible sales). Purchased Gas increased by al-
most $44,000, or 0.4%, in 1994 as comparedto 1993, based on an increase of 7.2% in
therms purchased, offset by a lower unit cost
of gas. Purchased Gas is normally recoverable
from customers through the cost of gas adjust-
ment mechanism.
Under Order 636, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) has allowed
gas pipeline suppliers to recover prudently in-
curred costs resulting from the transition into a
deregulated environment. The Company's
combination gas & electric utility operating
subsidiary has been incurring FERC-approved
transition charges from its natural gas pipeline
supplier since 1992. Through the end of 1995,
the amount of transition costs incurred by the
Company totaled approximately $2,200,000.
These costs are being recovered directly from
gas customers through the cost of gas adjust-
ment mechanism. On the basis of estimates in-
cluded in rate filings before the FERC and
other publicly available information, the Com-
pany currently estimates that it may incur up to
an additional $1,200,000 of transition costs in fu-
ture years. The Company expects full recovery of
these costs through billings to customers.
Operation and Maintenance expense in-
creased by about $900,000, or 4.2%, in 1995
compared to 1994. This increase primarily re-
flects higher conservation and load manage-
ment program expenditures (which are recov-
erable from customers through periodic cost
recovery mechanisms). In 1995, expenditures
on this component of operation and mainte-
nance expenses were over $2.1 million-a
30% increase over 1994's conservation and
load management program expenditure level.
Excluding these costs, the System's total oper-
ating and maintenance costs were relatively
unchanged in 1995 compared to 1994. This
performance primarily reflects the success of
the Company's disciplined approach to cost
management practices and procedures.
In 1994, Operation and Maintenance ex-
pense increased by almost $900,000, or 4.3%.
Almost one-third of this increase in Operation
and Maintenance was due to a 20% rise in ex-
penditures on demand-side management and
conservation programs during 1994, as com-
pared to 1993. The remaining increase in
1994's Operation and Maintenance reflects
modest overall growth of about $500,000, or
2.7%, in the System's operation and mainte-
nance costs. The majority of this increase was
due to extensive gas distribution system main-
tenance and repairs conducted in 1994.
Depreciation,
Amortization and Taxes
Depreciation and Amortization expense
increased more than 3% for both 1995 and
1994 over the prior year, due primarily to a
higher level of plant in service.
Amortization of the Cost of Abandoned
Properties principally relates to the abandon-
ment of an investment in the Seabrook Nuclear
Power Plant by the Company's Massachusetts
retail operating subsidiary. A portion of the
former investment in this project is being re-
covered in rates to electric customers, as al-
lowed by the Massachusetts Department of
Public Utilities.
Federal and State Income Taxes remained
relatively unchanged in 1995 compared to
1994, despite an increase in net income before
taxes of approximately $309,000, or 2.5%. This
result primarily reflects nonrecurring tax ben-
efits realized by the Company from a donation
of land to the Park 2000 project Fitchburg,
Massachusetts, and the tax loss realized on the
State of New Hampshire's taking by eminent
domain of the Company's corporate headquar-
ters in Exeter, New Hampshire. Federal and
State Income Taxes increased by $462,000, or
12.5%, in 1994, due to higher net income be-
fore taxes of approximately $900,000.
Local Property Taxes increased $353,956,
or 13.2%, in 1995. This increase mainly reflects
the annual property tax increases set by local
communities. Local Property taxes increased in
1994, compared to 1993, by 14.4%.
Non-Operating Expenses
For 1995, Non-Operating Expenses in-
creased approximately $152,700, primarily re-
flecting a $141,000 non-operating loss, as a re-
sult of the State of New Hampshire's taking by
eminent domain of the Company's corporate
headquarters in Exeter, New Hampshire.

Interest Expense
Interest Expense, Net remained relatively
unchanged in 1995 over 1994, as interest in-
come and reduced short-term borrowing costs
offset increased long-term debt-related interest
costs. Higher long-term debt interest costs in
1995, compared to the prior year, reflect the
conversion of short-term debt into long-term
debt in late 1994 by the Company's New
Hampshire retail operating subsidiaries.
Interest Expense decreased approximately
12% in 1994 compared to 1993, due primarily to
the refinancing of long-term debt at lower interest
rates. Also contributing to lower interest costs
was the general decline in short-term borrowing
costs during this period.
Capital Requirements
and Liquidity
The Unitil System companies require capital
for the acquisition of property, plant and equip-
ment in order to improve, protect, maintain
and expand their electric and gas operating sys-
tems. Capital necessary to meet these require-
ments is derived primarily from the Company's
retained earnings and through the System's Divi-
dend Reinvestment and Common Share Pur-
chase Plan. When internally generated funds are
not available, it is the Company's policy to bor-
row interim funds on a short-term basis to meet
the capital requirements of its subsidiaries and,
when necessary, to repay short-term debt
through the issuance of permanent financing
on an individual company basis. The size and
timing of such financings depend on develop-
ments in the securities markets, the ability to
meet certain financing covenants and the receipt
of appropriate regulatory approval. The Com-
pany attempts to maintain a conservative capi-
talization structure, which contributes to both
the stability of Unitil and its ability to market
new securities. The Company has been able to
access the financial markets to meet its capital re-
quirements and does not anticipate a change in
its access to, or the availability of, capital in the
coming year.

$12,645 $8,943 $7,714
Cash flow from investing activities in-
creased approximately $3.7 million in 1995, as
a result of planned spending for utility system
improvements, as well as the State of New
Hampshire's taking by eminent domain of the
Company's current headquarters and the asso-
ciated commencement of construction of a
new corporate headquarters. Total capital ex-
penditures increased by $5.7 million in 1995,
to $14.6 million, reflecting increased spending
of approximately $2.3 million for normal utility
system improvements and $3.4 million for the
construction on a new corporate headquarters.
These increases of capital expenditures were
offset by proceeds of $2.0 million from the tak-
ing of the Company's corporate headquarters.
In February 1995, Unitil's corporate head-
quarters, located in Exeter, New Hampshire,
was taken by the State of New Hampshire
through eminent domain in connection with
the State's Route 101 highway expansion
project. While the impact of this transaction
has been fully recognized in the financial re-
sults for 1995, Unitil is currently appealing the
valuation placed upon its land and building by
the State during the taking process and is seek-
ing additional compensation. As a result of this
taking, the Company purchased land in Hamp-
ton, New Hampshire, during 1995, and began
construction of a new corporate headquarters,
which is scheduled for completion during the
summer of 1996.
In 1996, total capital expenditures are ex-
pected to approximate $18.9 million. This pro-
jection reflects capital expenditures of approxi-
mately $14.8 million for normal utility system
expansions, replacements and other improve-
ments and capital expenditures of approximately
$4.1 million related to the completion of con-
struction of the new corporate headquarters.Financial Activities ($000's)

The change in cash flows from financing

reflects increases in the System's short-term
borrowings and capitalized lease obligations at
year end, as detailed in the Consolidated State-
ments of Cash Flows. Short-term borrowing re-
quirements are met through Unitil's committed
credit facilities with three different banks,
which currently total $10 million.
$5,789
No long-term debt was issued by any of
the Unitil System companies during 1995.
However, during both 1994 and 1993, Unitil's
three retail operating companies completed
private placements of long-term debt. The
funds generated by these transactions were pri-
marily used to repay the short-term indebted-
ness incurred by each System company to fund
its ongoing construction programs, and to re-
deem higher-coupon long-term debt issues
prior to their maturity. The impact of these
transactions has been to lower the average
cost of the System's long-term debt portfolio.
The Company does expect to undertake a
long-term financing for Uniti! Realty Corp. dur-
ing 1996, following the completion of construc-
tion on the new corporate headquarters. The
purpose of this financing will be to repay short-
term debt incurred to finance construction of
the building.
During 1995, the Company raised
$1,009,499 of additional common equity capi-
tal through the issuance of 58,457 shares of
common stock in connection with the Divi-
dend Reinvestment and Tax Deferred Savings
and Investment plans. The Company raised
$1,037,809 of additional common equity capi-
tal in 1994 and $880,154 of additional equity
capital in 1993, rough the respective issu-
ance of 58,229 and 46,291 shares of common
stock in connection with these plans. The Com-
pany also issued shares during each of the
years from 1993 through 1995, as a result of
the exercise of options granted under the
Company's Key Employee Stock Option Plan
(KESOP). The total number of shares issued un-
der the KESOP plan in 1995, 1994 and 1993
were 3,291 shares, 4,110 shares and 6,966
shares, respectively.
Regulatory Matters
At the state level in both New Hampshire
and Massachusetts, and at the federal level, re-
cent regulatory activity has focused on determin-
ing how to deregulate the retail sale of electricity
to allow for a more competitive market. As the
trend continues towards competition in the elec-
tric utility industry, Unitil has actively participated
in industry, legislative and regulatory proceedings
on the issues of competition and industry restruc-
turing at both the federal and state levels, favor-
ing a reasonable and orderly transition to compe-
tition and more choice for all customers.
Both the New Hampshire Public Utilities
Commission (NHPUC) and the New Hampshire
Legislature have been involved in discussions and
analysis relative to competition in the industry.
Early in 1995, the NHPUC issued an order in re-
sponse to a petition by a power marketer seeking
to sell to certain industrial customers of an inves-
tor-owned New Hampshire utility. In that order,
the NHPUC ruled that utilities in New Hampshire
do not have exclusive franchise territories as a
matter of law and directed the marketer to seek a
declaratory order from the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission regarding its proposed trans-
actions. This decision has been appealed to the
New Hampshire Supreme Court. In June 1995,
New Hampshire Senate Bill 168 (SB 168), was
signed into law. SB 168 establishes a legislative
committee to consider changes in the structure
of the electric utility industry. The act also directs
the NHPUC to begin a retail competition pilot
program and to act within five months to estab-
lish standards for utility discounts to industrial cus-
tomers. The legislative committee and its sub-
committees met regularly during the summer and
fall of 1995. Several members sponsored new
legislation, including legislation currently being
debated that would require utilities to file restruc
turing plans with the NHPUC by June 1996, with
state-wide retail competition by June 1998. The
NHPUC has issued its preliminary guidelines for
the retail competition pilot program, incorporat-
ing implementation by May 1996, and is ex-
pected to issue its final guidelines in March 1996.
The NHPUC issued its final guidelines on dis-
count rates for industrial customers in November
1995. The NHPUC approved the Company's En-
ergy BankTM program in accordance with these
guidelines in December 1995.

During 1995, the Massachusetts Department
of Public Utilities (MDPU) concluded the initial
hearings in an electric industry restructuring
docket, and has issued an order requiring the
three largest Massachusetts electric utilities to file
restructuring plans in February 1996, and the re-
maining Massachusetts electric utilities (including
FG&E) to file restructuring plans three months af-
ter the MDPU issues orders regarding the first
three plans.
CECO, E&H and FG&E have all received regu-
latory approval for the Company's Energy Bank
program. Energy BankTM is an innovative eco-
nomic development program designed to bring
low-cost energy to new and expanding industrial
customers. With rates in the range of 5¢/KWH
this program offers electric energy at a price that
is equal to the national average industrial rate
and is 40% below the current average industrial
rate in New England. In addition to providing
substantial benefits to new and expanding indus-
trial customers in the form of very competitive
and responsive market pricing, Energy BankTM will
also provide significant benefits to all the System's
customers in the form of local economic develop-
ment activity, reduced power costs and lower
costs to all customers through the issuance of
Power Dividends.
The last formal regulatory hearings to in-
crease base rates for Unitil's three retail operating
subsidiaries occurred in 1985 for Concord Elec-
tric Company, 1984 for Fitchburg Gas and Elec-
tric Light Company and 1981 for Exeter & Hamp-
ton Electric Company. A majority of the System's
operating revenues are collected under various
periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including:
fuel, purchased power, cost of gas and conserva-
tion program cost recovery mechanisms.
Environmental
The Company continues to work with federal
and state environmental agencies to assess the
environmental contamination in the vicinity of
former gas manufacturing sites operated by Fitch-
burg Gas and Electric Light Company, the
Company's combination gas and electric operat-
ing subsidiary. Based on information developed
over the last several years, it has been discovered
that there is environmental contamination at a
former gas manufacturing plant in Fitchburg, MA
(the Sawyer Passway site). In December 1995 the
Company accepted a Tier 1B permit from the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) to address the site, pursuant to
the requirements of the Massachusetts Contin-
gency Plan. Further investigations are necessary
to assess the extent and nature of the contamina-
tion, and to evaluate potential remedies. Reports
on those investigations are due to be filed with
the DEP in early 1997. Because these investiga-
tions are at an early stage, management cannot,
at this time, predict the costs of future analysis
and remediation. The costs of such assessments
and any remedial action determined to be neces-
sary will initially be funded from traditional
sources of capital and recovered from customers
under a rate recovery mechanism approved by
the MDPU. The Company also has a number of
liability insurance policies that may provide cov-
erage for environmental remediation at this site.
New
Accounting Standards
Effective for fiscal years beginning after De-
cember 15, 1995, Statement of Financial Ac-
counting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121) "Ac-
counting for the Impairment of Long-lived As-
sets and for Long-lived Assets to be Disposed
of," will require the Company to review long-
lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the car-
rying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
It is expected that the adoption of this stan-
dard will not have a material impact on the re-
sults of operations, financial condition or cash
flows of the Company.
Effective for fiscal 1996, SFAS No. 123, "Ac-
counting for Stock-Based Compensation," is re-
quired to be implemented. This statement pro-
des the Company with the choice to con-
tinue with its current method of accounting for
stock-based compensation or to adopt a new
"fair value" method contained in SFAS No.
123. The Company expects to continue with its
current method of accounting for stock-based

TO CONSolidated Financial Statements
Note 1: Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations - The Company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a
holding company (with subsidiaries providing electric service in New Hampshire, electric and gas service in
Massachusetts and consulting services on energy-related matters) under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (1935 Act), and it and its subsidiaries are subject to the provisions of the 1935 Act. In addition, the
Company and several of its wholly-owned utility operating subsidiaries; Concord Electric Company (CECO),
Exeter & Hampton Electric Company (E&H), Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company (FG&E) and Unitil
Power Corp. (Unitil Power) are subject to regulation by various other agencies. With respect to their rates and
accounting, two of the retail subsidiaries, CECO and E&H, are subject to regulation by the New Hampshire
Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC); FG&E is subject to regulation by the Massachusetts Department of Pub-
lic Utilities (MDPU); and Unitil Power is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
CECO, E&H, FG&E and Unitil Power conform with generally accepted accounting principles, as applied in the
case of regulated public utilities, and conform with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of
the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction.
Principles of Consolidation - Unitil Corporation (the Company) is the parent company of the Unitil Sys-
tem (the System). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation.
Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and li-
abilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the re-
ported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those es-
timates.
Revenue Recognition - The Company's operating subsidiaries record electric and gas operating revenues based
upon the amount of electricity and gas delivered to customers through the end of the accounting period.
Depreciation - Depreciation provisions for the Company's utility operating subsidiaries are determined on a
group straight-line basis. Provisions for depreciation were equivalent to the following composite rates, based on
the average depreciable property balances at the beginning and end of each year: 1995 - 3.48 percent; 1994 -
3.49 percent; and 1993 - 3.53 percent.
Amortization of Abandoned Properties - FG&E is recovering a portion of a former investment in the
Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in rates to its customers through a Seabrook Amortization Surcharge, as
allowed by the MDPU.
Federal Income Taxes- Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the Statement of Financial Ac-
counting Standards No. 109 (SFAS No. 109) "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of as-
sets and liabilities, and are measured by applying tax rates applicable to the taxable years in which those differ-
ences are expected to reverse.
The Tax Reduction Act of 1986 eliminated investment tax credits. Investment tax credits generated prior to
27
Unitil28
1986 are being amortized, for financial reporting purposes, over the productive lives of the related assets.
New Accounting Standards — Effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995, Statement of Finan-
cial Accounting Standards No. 121 (SFAS 121) "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and For
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of," will require a review of long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. It is
expected that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the cash flows, financial condi-
tion or results of operations of the Company.
Effective for fiscal 1996, SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," is required to be
implemented. This statement provides the Company with the choice to continue with its current method of ac-
counting for stock-based compensation or to adopt a new "fair value" method contained in SFAS No. 123. The
Company expects to continue with its current method of accounting for stock-based compensation and to pro-
vide the SFAS No. 123 required disclosures in the notes to the financial statements.
Reclassifications - Reclassification of amounts are made periodically to previously issued financial statements
to conform with the current year presentation.
Note 2: Common Stock
New Shares Issued - During 1995, the Company raised $1,009,499 of additional common equity capital
through the issuance of 58,457 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and
Stock Purchase Plan and Employee 401(k) Tax Deferred Savings and Investment Plan. The Dividend Reinvest-
ment and Stock Purchase Plan provides participants in the plan a method for investing cash dividends on the
Company's Common Stock and cash payments in additional shares of the Company's Common Stock. The Em-
ployee 401(k) Tax Deferred Savings and Investment Plan is described in Note 9 below. In 1994, the Company
raised $1,037,809 of additional common equity capital through issuance of 58,229 shares of common stock in
connection with these plans.
The Company maintains a Key Employee Stock Option Plan (KESOP), which provides for the granting of
options to key employees. The number of shares granted under this plan, as well as the terms and conditions of
each grant, are determined by the Board of Directors, subject to plan limitations. All options granted under the
KESOP expire within 10 years of the grant date, and no option can be issued under the current plan after 1999.
The KESOP also includes shares related to the FG&E option plan, which was merged into the KESOP upon the
merger of FG&E into the Company. The plan provides for dividend equivalents on options granted, which are
recorded as compensation expense. The total compensation expenses recorded by the Company with respect
to this plan were $248,127, $180,475 and $177,425 for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and
1993, respectively.

Restrictions on Retained Earnings- Unitil Corporation has no restriction on the payment of common divi-
dends from retained earnings. Its three retail distribution subsidiaries do have restrictions. Under the terms of the
First Mortgage Bond Indentures, CECO and E&H had $5,402,238 and $8,031,846, respectively, available for the
payment of cash dividends on their common stock at December 31, 1995. Under the terms of long-term debt
Purchase Agreements, FG&E had $11,500,927 of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends
on its common stock at December 31, 1995.Note 3: Preferred Stock
Certain of the Unitil subsidiaries have redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock outstanding and one
subsidiary, CECO, has a Non-Redeemable, Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock issue outstanding. All such sub-
sidiaries are required to offer to redeem annually a given number of shares of each series of Redeemable
Cumulative Preferred Stock and to purchase such shares that shall have been tendered by holders of the
respective stock. All such subsidiaries may redeem, at their option, the Redeemable Cumulative Preferred
Stock at a given redemption price, plus accrued dividends.
The aggregate purchases of Redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock during 1995, 1994 and 1993
were: 1995 - $94,700; 1994 - $104,100; and 1993 - $78,800. The aggregate amount of sinking fund re-
quirements of the redeemable Cumulative Preferred Stock for each of the five years following 1995 are
$206,000 per year.
Note 4: Long-Term Debt
On October 14, 1994, CECo.arranged for the private placement, at par, of $6,000,000 of 30-year Series !
First Mortgage Bonds, bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 8.49% and maturing in 2024. The proceeds of this
financing were utilized to repay short-term indebtedness and to redeem two higher-coupon long-term debt is-
sues prior to their maturity. The redemptions included $930,000 of Series D First Mortgage Bonds, 8.70%, due
November 15, 2001, and $1,500,000 of Series G First Mortgage Bonds, 9.85%, due October 15, 1997.
On October 14, 1994, E&H arranged for the private placement, at par, of $9,000,000 of 30-year Series K
First Mortgage Bonds, bearing a fixed annual interest rate of 8.49% and maturing in 2024. The proceeds of this
financing were utilized to repay short-term indebtedness and to redeem three higher-coupon long-term debt is-
sues prior to their maturity. The redemptions included $1,235,000 of Series F First Mortgage Bonds, 8.70%,
due November 15, 2001, $930,000 of Series G First Mortgage Bonds, 8.875%, due April 1, 2004, and
$1,400,000 of Series | First Mortgage Bonds, 9.85%, due October 15, 1997.
Under the terms of CECO's Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust and the supplemental indenture
thereto relating to long-term debt, the sinking fund requirements of CECo's Series C Bonds may be satisfied by
certifying to the Mortgage Trustee "net additional property" in lieu of making cash redemptions. In 1995 and
1994, CECO satisfied its requirements with respect to its Series C Bonds by certifying to the Mortgage Trustee
"net additional property." In 1995, sinking fund payments relating to long-term debt amounted to $112,000.
Certain of the loan agreements contain provisions which limit the incurrence of additional long-term debt.
The aggregate amount of sinking fund requirements and normal scheduled redemptions for each of the five years
following 1995 are: 1996-$1,294,000;1997-$1,294,000;1998-$4,307,000;1999-$2,290,000, and 2000-$2,290,000.
The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or
similar issues, or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. In manage-
ment's opinion, the carrying value of the debt approximated its fair value at December 31, 1995 and 1994.
Note 5: Credit Arrangements
At December 31, 1995, the Company had unsecured committed bank lines for short-term debt aggregat-
ing $10,000,000 with three banks for which it pays commitment fees. At December 31, 1995, the unused por-
tion of the committed credit lines outstanding was $7,300,000. The average interest rate on all short-term bor-
rowings was 6.59%.
Note 6: Leases
The Company's subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in leased facilities and also lease some of
their operations and office equipment. FG&E has a facility lease for 22 years which began in February 1981.
The lease allows five, five-year renewal periods at the option of FG&E. The equipment leases include a 25-year
lease which began on April 1, 1973, for a combustion turbine and a liquefied natural gas storage and vaporiza-
tion facility. This lease provides for a 10-year renewal period at the option of FG&E. In addition, Unitil's sub-
29

Plan assets are invested in common stock, short-term investments and various other fixed income security funds.
The weighted-average discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation in 1995, 1994
and 1993 were 7.75%, 8.25% and 7.75%, respectively, while the rate of increase in future compensation levels
was 4.50%, 4.50% and 4.50%, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was 9.50% in
each of the years 1995, 1994 and 1993.
Effective January 1, 1987, Unitil Service Corp. adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP).
The SERP is an unfunded retirement plan with participation limited to executives selected by the Board of Di-rectors. The cost associated with the SERP amounted to $60,000; $53,000; and $53,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Employee 401(k) Tax Deferred Savings Plan - The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan ((under Sec-
tion 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code)) covering substantially all of the Company's employees. Participants
may elect to defer from 1% to 12% of current compensation to the plan. The Company matches contributions,
with a maximum matching contribution of 3% of current compensation. Employees may direct the investment
of their savings plan balances into a variety of investment options, including a Company common stock fund.
Participants are 100% vested, once completing three years of service, in contributions made on their behalf.
The Company's share of contributions to the plan were $301,486; $284,248; and $266,645 for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Post-Retirement Benefits - Effective as of January 1, 1993, the Company's subsidiaries significantly modified
the duration of post-retirement health care benefits. From that date forward, all current retirees were offered
such benefits only for an additional 12-month period and all future retirees will be entitled to such benefits for a
12-month period following their retirement. The Company's subsidiaries continue to provide life insurance cov-
erage to retirees by making monthly premium payments to a life insurer. Life insurance and limited health care
post-retirement benefits required the Company to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Post-retirement Benefits Other than Pensions" — (SFAS 106). For
1995 and 1994, the costs associated with providing health care and life insurance benefits under this arrange-
ment were $86,522 and $82,625. This statement requires accrual accounting for post-retirement benefits dur-
ing the employee's years of service with the Company and the recognition of the actuarially determined total
post-retirement benefit obligation earned by existing retirees. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the accumu-
lated post-retirement benefit obligation (transition obligation) was approximately $364,000 and $385,000, re-
spectively, under SFAS 106. This obligation is being recognized on a delayed basis over the average remaining
service period of active participants, and such period will not exceed 20 years. The Company has omitted cer-
tain disclosures relating to SFAS 106, as the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation (transition obliga-
tion) is not material.
Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies
Environmental Matters The Company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies
to assess the environmental contamination in the vicinity of former gas manufacturing sites operated by
Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company, the Company's combination gas and electric operating subsid-
iary. Based on information developed over the last several years, it has been discovered that there is envi-
ronmental contamination at a former gas manufacturing plant in Fitchburg, MA (the Sawyer Passway site).
In December 1995, the Company accepted a Tier 1B permit from the Massachusetts Department of Envi-
ronmental Protection (DEP) to address the site, pursuant to the requirements of the Massachusetts Contin-
gency Plan. Further investigations are necessary to assess the extent and nature of the contamination,
and to evaluate potential remedies. Reports on those investigations are due to be filed with the DEP in
early 1997. Because these investigations are at an early stage, management cannot, at this time, predict
the costs of future analysis and remediation. The costs of such assessments and any remedial action deter-
mined to be necessary will initially be funded from traditional sources of capital and recovered from cus-
tomers under a rate recovery mechanism approved by the MDPU. The Company also has a number of li-
ability insurance policies that may provide coverage for environmental remediation at this site.
Regulatory Matters - At the state level in both New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and at the federal
level, recent regulatory activity has focused on determining how to deregulate the retail sale of electricity
to allow for a more competitive market. As the trend continues towards competition in the electric utility
industry, Unitil has actively participated in industry, legislative and regulatory proceedings on the issues of
competition and industry restructuring at both the federal and state levels, favoring a reasonable and or-
derly transition to competition and more choice for all customers.
33
Unitil34
Both the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (NHPUC) and the New Hampshire Legislature
have been involved in discussions and analysis relative to competition in the industry. Early in 1995, the
NHPUC issued an order in response to a petition by a power marketer seeking to sell to certain industrial
customers of an investor-owned New Hampshire utility. In that order the NHPUC ruled that utilities in
New Hampshire do not have exclusive franchise territories as a matter of law, and directed the marketer to
seek a declaratory order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regarding its proposed transac-
tions. This decision has been appealed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. In June 1995, New Hamp-
shire Senate Bill 168 (SB 168) was signed into law. SB 168 establishes a legislative committee to consider
changes in the structure of the electric utility industry. The act also directs the NHPUC to begin a retail
competition pilot program and to act within five months to establish standards for utility discounts to indus-
trial customers. The legislative committee and its subcommittees met regularly during the summer and fall
of 1995. Several members sponsored new legislation, including legislation currently being debated that
would require utilities to file restructuring plans with the NHPUC by June 1996, with statewide retail com-
petition by June 1998. The NHPUC has issued its preliminary guidelines for the retail competition pilot pro-
gram, incorporating implementation by May 1996, and is expected to issue its final guidelines in March
1996. The NHPUC issued its final guidelines on discount rates for industrial customers in November 1995.
The NHPUC approved the Company's Energy BankTM program in accordance with these guidelines in De-
cember 1995.
During 1995, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MDPU) concluded the initial hearings
in an electric industry restructuring docket and has issued an order requiring the three largest Massachusetts
electric utilities to file restructuring plans in February 1996, and the remaining Massachusetts electric utili-
ties (including FG&E) to file restructuring plans three months after the MDPU issues orders regarding the first
three plans.
CECO, E&H and FG&E have all received regulatory approval for the Company's Energy Bank™ program.
Energy BankTM is an innovative economic development program designed to bring low-cost energy to new
and expanding industrial customers. With rates in the range of 5¢/KWH this program offers electric energy
at a price that is equal to the national average industrial rate and is 40% below the current average indus-
trial rate in New England. In addition to providing substantial benefits to new and expanding industrial cus-
tomers in the form of very competitive and responsive market pricing, Energy BankTM will also provide sig-
nificant benefits to all the System's customers in the form of local economic development activity, reduced
power costs and lower costs to all customers through the issuance of Power Dividends.
The last formal regulatory hearings to increase base rates for Unitil's three retail operating subsidiaries
occurred in 1985 for Concord Electric Company, 1984 for Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company and
1981 for Exeter & Hampton Electric Company. A majority of the System's operating revenues are collected
under various periodic rate adjustment mechanisms including: fuel, purchased-power, cost of gas and con-
servation program cost recovery mechanisms.
Litigation - The Company is also involved in other legal and administrative proceedings and claims of
various types which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of the Company's management,
based upon information furnished by counsel and others, the ultimate resolution of these claims will not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position.
Purchased Power and Gas Supply Contracts - FG&E and Unitil Power have commitments under long-
term contracts for the purchase of electricity and gas from various suppliers. Generally, these contracts are
for fixed periods and require payment of demand and energy charges. Total costs under these contracts are
included in Electricity and Gas Purchased for Resale in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs
are normally recoverable in revenues under various cost recovery mechanisms.
The status of the electric purchased power contracts at December 31, 1995, was as follows (next page):

Expenses used to determine operating income before taxes are charged directly to either segment or are allo-

proved by the NHPUC and MDPU. Assets allocated to each segment are based upon specific identification of such
assets provided by Company records. Assets not so identified represent primarily working capital items.Grant Thornton
GRANT THORNTON LLP
Report of Independent Certified Public
Accountant to the Shareholders of
Unitil Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consoli-
dated statements of capitalization of Unitil Corporation and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the related consolidated statements of
earnings, cash flows and changes in common stock equity for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Unitil Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1995, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
