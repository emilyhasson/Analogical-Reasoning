Argentina
Dominion Energy has upgraded its pow-
er plant at Alto Valle, Argentina, making
it more competitive in that nation's pri-
vatized market. Argentina uses a nation-
al economic dispatch program, which is
simply starting with the most efficient,
least costly plant to meet load require-
ments and going down the list from
there. To be a competitive player in this
international energy market, Dominion
Energy instituted a combined cycle pro-
gram which lowered the current gener-
ation cost of $20 per megawatt-hour to
around $12 per megawatt-hour. This
bumps Alto Valle up about 15 plants in
terms of dispatch sequence for supply-
ing electricity.

Dominion Energy's focus on becoming
a major player in competitive regional
markets for natural gas was realized
A
through the purchase and consolidation
of three natural gas companies in the
Appalachian Basin that were managing
properties we owned. This is Dominion
Energy's first move into actual daily
operations and management of active
properties-a principal strategy enabling
the company to capture new efficien-
cies, exploit natural synergies and
decrease operating costs while improv-

cost was $11 million and adds nearly 50
billion cubic feet of reserves to
Dominion Energy's assets, nearly dou-
bling its holdings in the Appalachian

Dominion Capital's strategy to narrow
the number of business lines it has in
order to focus on growth in its financial
services investments was followed
through its joint venture in First Source
Financial. This new business will serve
the nation's growing demand for loans
from mid-sized corporations who are
the strongest growth sector of our econ-
omy. The business strategy is to pro-
vide loans based on a company's
strength in cash flows, rather than in
assets. First Source Financial, head-
quartered in Chicago, has a solid and
diversified portfolio of loans to well-
established, non-high tech, manufactur-
ing companies totaling $600 million.
Australia
Dominion Energy's strategy to pursue
overseas natural gas production oppor-
tunities was carried out through a joint
venture with Enron. The companies will
explore coal fields of Queensland,
Australia for coal bed methane reserves
that could be marketed to support com-
mercial and industrial growth in the
eastern cities of Brisbane, Gladstone
and Townsville and the western mining
area of Mount ISA. Under the joint ven-
ture, Enron and Dominion Energy
could spend up to $80 million apiece if
further testing and initial efforts yield
encouraging results. Two wells have
just been drilled and will be tested
through the first quarter of 1996.

Our network of coal

sharpen their competitive edge through better energy management by
selling a full range of energy products and services. EVANTAGE is ready to
advise customers on energy use and management, fuel procurement, and
electrical system maintenance, for example, or to produce energy on their
behalf. In short, EVANTAGE will be their energy expert and energy
partner. Consider the complex and costly process of designing, permitting
and building a power plant-something we know quite well. It's why
Chesapeake Paper Products Co. has turned to EVANTAGE to build and
own a generator to serve the energy needs of a major paper facility in
eastern Virginia. The project marked several important firsts in the new
world of power. It's the new group's first major agreement. It's the first
application of an innovative program to site and build generators on the property of major customers that want to self-
generate their power. And it is among the first times that a major industrial customer has
turned to its utility for expert help in designing and constructing one. Another example
of teamwork and innovation at EVANTAGE is found in a newly signed contract to design
and construct a transmission line for an electrical service cooperative-one of the many
utility, commercial, industrial and governmental customers that make up a robust poten-
tial market within Virginia Power's economically vibrant service area. We will be building

our company's strategic planning and
vigorous implementation of those plans in
1995 enhanced its outlook for success in the
exciting and increasingly competitive world of
power and energy.
At Virginia Power, we're putting ourselves
through a major restructuring process known as
Vision 2000-which is intensifying our focus on
our customers and their needs. We're cutting
costs and downsizing. We're reconfiguring
ourselves to do the same things better and more
quickly, and have added new skills and business
capabilities too. We're putting the finishing
touches on our strategies for offense and
defense to develop new revenues and keep
existing ones.
On defense, the strategies protect our existing
market share by keeping production costs low
while offering customers even better prices.
We're also improving customer service to
ensure loyalty to the Virginia Power brand and
by signing customers to long-term contracts.
On offense, the strategies promote revenue
growth through bulk power sales in broadening
wholesale markets and new lines of customized
energy services through a corporate unit named
EVANTAGE. EVANTAGE is rolling out new
products and services for valued commercial,
governmental and industrial customers, the
first groups planning to shop in the forming

Construction of the energy supermarket is still
under way. A wholesale generation section is
already open and could grow quite rapidly under
anticipated federal regulatory changes. Other

sections for marketing and customer services
are still in progress. Nobody knows when federal
and state regulations will open the store to
everyone, or how it will ultimately look, but
Virginia Power is preparing an impressive
product line.
As our strategy succeeds in the competitive
future, we will continue to be guided by our
five core values: customer focus, performance,
innovation, teamwork and integrity.
Our teams at Dominion Energy and Dominion
Capital are also increasing the value of your
company shares through successful competition
in markets for independent electric power in
other states and nations, natural gas, financial
services and real estate. Once Dominion Energy
and Dominion Capital were viewed by many as
a simple boost to earnings from the core utility
business. Now we're substantial, established
businesses in our own right, with $2 billion in
assets producing 10 percent of your company's
income, with our own strategic plans. We're
focusing on operating earnings at both com-
panies by directly managing more ventures
that produce steady streams of income. There
will be fewer one-time transactions and passive
investments. In all cases, we'll build on past
successes with ventures that produce enduring
shareholder value.
At all business units of Dominion Resources,
we'll accomplish that with focused growth-

expansions into new markets on one hand
with growing profits and shareholder returns
on the other.

people. And yet we could not have
done otherwise and fulfilled our
responsibilities to our owners, our
customers and our other employ-
ees. Other sectors of the American
industry found themselves barely
able to compete in a world market
just a few years ago. Productivity
had not kept pace with worldwide
competitors. Thus began the
"downsizing," "rightsizing," "re-
engineering," or whatever one
chooses to call the painful process.
But the American industrial sector
today is probably the most efficient
and productive in the world as a
result. Now the utility industry will
face competition for the first time. It
finds itself in the same position as
the other sectors found themselves
earlier. Letting excess employees go
is painful, but absolutely necessary
if your company is to survive in a
competitive market. As the
industrial sector found, good quality
and service are taken for granted:
price is what sells. So will it be with
the electric industry. Electricity will
sell on price. To get our price as low
as possible we must go after costs
with a vengeance. This is what we
are doing. And on top of that, we
are creating innovative services that
increase our competitiveness even
more. Thank goodness the bulk of
our restructuring costs are now
behind us. You can look to our
operating income as a key sign of
our fundamental strengths.
Regrettably, we could not increase
your dividend in 1995 because we
must gradually lower the percen-

dividends. But the extensive
initiatives that we undertook in
1995 should pave the way for the
earnings growth that will lower our

as part of our customer focus, in our service area and beyond. Some
companies resist change. We see it as an opportunity for focused growth.
So when changes in federal law created new opportunities for bulk tran-
sactions in wholesale power, Virginia Power acted swiftly. We found five
times more trading partners and tripled our sales of wholesale power to
more than 2 million megawatt-hours. We moved more than 1 million
megawatt-hours of power over our transmission lines for use by other
utilities and power marketers. We won bids to provide 300 megawatts of
peaking power to Ohio Edison and Kentucky Utilities and responded to
demand created by last summer's heat wave by making short-term sales to
markets as far afield as Chicago and St. Louis. That's sound offense. It's
possible because Virginia Power has an advantage as one of America's low-
cost producers. We repeated another year of superior plant performance at
our nuclear, fossil-fuel and hydroelectric facilities, easily beating industry
efficiency averages in 1995. Low-cost production is the foundation on which ultimate success lies. It takes teamwork-
like the teamwork demonstrated by the dedicated staff at our fossil fuel and hydroelectric stations who've accomplished
a 30 percent reduction in operating and maintenance expenses while undergoing workforce reductions of 30 percent; or
the teamwork of our nuclear generation staff who carried out a major steam generator replacement in a world-record 68
days-and $16 million under budget. Moreover, these steps to assure low-cost production have allowed us to grow
earnings without an increase in customer rates since 1992 and to
actually reduce our fuel rates last year by more than $107 million.
But we're well aware that other producers are striving to catch up.
That's why Virginia Power is carrying out even more restructuring
and still cutting costs aggressively, reducing its total workforce
some 25 percent since 1987 without sacrifices in safety or reliability.
Specific core functions that were formerly blended into the overall
organization are being set up as entirely separate business units.
This will help all employees in a given unit to see more clearly how
their drive for superior performance contributes to overall
Stronger relationships with wholesale customers

nuclear generation, fossil and hydroelectric generation, energy services
and commercial operations. Commercial operations directs the part of our
business most visible to customers on a daily basis: transmission, distrib-
ution and customer service activities. Work to streamline commercial
operations further is still under way. We started a major re-engineering
effort in 1995, and important savings have already been realized: five
separate geographic divisions that made up the commercial operations
structure were consolidated into three. Another change that improved both

in fact, that they produce $300 million in annual revenues. Last year Virginia Power made this vital group an offer to
improve pricing flexibility. Known as Real-Time Pricing, it bases a portion of the hill each day on the actual cost of daily
generation, and it's catching on. So far, nine companies have taken advantage of or said they plan to take advantage of
the program, which requires a five-year customer commitment. Cooperatives and other wholesale customers that purchase
power on a wholesale basis are another big and important group that produces about $200 million in annual revenues. So
Virginia Power has negotiated long-term contracts that contain "win-win" terms for both parties. By the end of 1995,
virtually all major wholesale customers had signed power-purchase contracts ranging from eight to 10 years in duration.
On both sides of the competitive playing field, Virginia Power is poised to emerge a winner.

idea will be to let the independents revitalize and retune the stations in preparation for
competition in open markets. At home in the U.S., we were selected as the preferred
bidder to own and manage a 1,108-megawatt coal-fired station in Illinois, which will
double the number of company-owned nonutility megawatts when the transaction obtains
regulatory approval in late 1996. We're tempering our growth in new markets with
prudence-the view of an experienced international company now entering its seventh
year of foreign business. And we recognize that success takes more than growth. It
requires consistently reliable operation at existing generating stations-a standing goal
that we accomplished again in 1995 at plants in the U.S. and Latin America. In our

profitable natural gas division, we also stepped up the pace and scope of our activities in
the U.S. and abroad, another key part of the company's strategic plan. We entered an
exploratory venture with another major U.S. corporation in Queensland, Australia,
marking our first step into a potentially rewarding international market. In West Virginia,
Dominion Energy bought and merged three companies, doubling its Appalachian Basin reserves and creating one of
the larger operating companies now doing business there. Dominion Appalachian Development, Inc. is producing more
than 15 million cubic feet of natural gas each day. By supplementing our investments in gas reserves with the creation
of operating companies like this, we'll build future value. Our investments
in low-risk developmental drilling in Michigan, Utah and the Appalachian
Basin continue to add current value. So now we're expanding into other
regions of the U.S. where the risk and rewards are higher than past
activities, but the potential of even more value is realistic. New drilling
programs will start in Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, other states and
offshore Louisiana. We'll also explore foreign markets, with the venture in
Australia representing the first such step. At Dominion Energy, we will
evaluate investment opportunities in each of these related activities-
as we continue the business of focused growth in independent power and
natural gas.
In 1995, the government of Bolivia selected Dominion
Energy to acquire half-ownership and management
control of the nation's two largest hydroelectric
stations, with 126 megawatts of generating capability.
With a winning bid of $58.7 million, the company
expanded its position as a leader in generation in Latin

e've set the stage at Dominion Capital for sustained
growth in financial services, including energy-
sector and commercial-sector lending, an area familiar to the
company where it can earn superior returns and ongoing operating income. Demand for
loans among mid-sized companies is up. This “market niche" can be served profitably
with manageable risk. Last year began operations for our Chicago-based First Source
Financial lending venture to middle-sized companies, which we carried out with
Household Commercial Financial Services, Inc. First Source is poised to contribute
ongoing income growth with nearly $600 million in loans and expected growth to nearly
$1 billion by the end of 1996. We have decided to duplicate the idea of focused financial
services by specializing in the energy sector. In partnership with three other companies,
we are forming a new venture in 1996 to serve the financial needs of small- to medium-
sized gas and oil companies. Like First Source Financial, the venture provides one-stop
shopping for loans of various terms and conditions. Our existing energy-related investments sustained their excellent
performance record in 1995. The 192-megawatt Vidalia hydroelectric station in Louisiana produced another year of
reliable, environmentally friendly generation while providing vital flood control services on the Mississippi River. There
was continuing and consistent strong performance from our Rincon portfolio of preferred stocks, which are deployed
mainly in the securities of the utility industry. We had more profitability and growth in our real estate activities-
including Goodman Segar Hogan Hoffler, the Norfolk-based full-service commercial real estate firm. The company
leases and manages more than 17 million square feet of commercial property in the Southeast. Goodman Segar closed
the year positioned for growth with properties under management totaling more than $1.3 billion. It also combined
operations with an important commercial firm serving the fast-growing
Research Triangle area in North Carolina. At our residential real estate unit,
we completed a townhouse complex in Alexandria, positioned ourselves for
more growth in Northern Virginia by obtaining needed zoning at a well-
located tract on the Potomac River, and announced plans to develop a
residential complex between Richmond and Williamsburg. In financial
services, energy and real estate, we're looking to our second decade with a
focused strategy and optimism for continued strong results.

Virginia Power
Virginia Power's Operating Results
As part of the Vision 2000 program, Virginia Power recorded
$117.9 million of restructuring charges in 1995 (see Note ().
Restructuring charges included severance costs, purchased
power contract cancellation and negotiated settlement costs,
capital project cancellation costs and other costs. Without
restructuring costs, balance available for common stock in
1995 would have increased by $76,6 million.
Virginia Power will incur additional restructuring charges
in 1996. However, the amount of restructuring charges yet
to be incurred is not known at this time. Savings to be realized
will be reflected in lower construction expenditures, as well as
lower operation and maintenance expenses.
Virginia Power in 1994 recognized a net cost of $41.6 million
associated with voluntary separation and early retirement pack-
ages accepted by about 1,400 employees. In addition, lower
base revenues when compared with 1993 contributed to a
decrease in the balance available for common stock in 1994.

Virginia Power's Operating Revenues
In 1995 Virginia Power's revenues increased primarily due
to the weather experienced in the last six months of 1995,
increased customer growth and increased sales to wholesale
customers.
Revenues decreased in 1994 primarily because of lower
base revenues for Virginia jurisdictional and County and Muni-
cipal customers. In February 1994, Virginia Power received a
final order from the Virginia Commission in its 1992 base rate
case that lowered the allowed return on equity to 11.4%.

The increase in kilowatt-hour sales in 1995 as compared
to 1994 reflects increased customer growth and the weather
experienced in the last six months of 1995, partially offset by
the milder weather experienced in the first six months of 1995.
The increase in kilowatt-hour sales in 1994 as compared
to 1993 reflects the extreme weather experienced in January
1994, partially offset by lower sales during the second half
of 1994 because of milder weather.
7.8%
The increase in sales to wholesale customers in 1995 as
compared to 1994 was primarily due to weather experienced
in surrounding regions by other utilities during the last
six months of 1995 and increased marketing efforts by
Virginia Power.

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased
in 1995 as compared to 1994.
Expenses during 1994 included payroll and voluntary sepa-
ration costs for those employees who elected to terminate
service with Virginia Power under the 1994 Early Retirement
and Voluntary Separation Programs, offset in part by recogni-
tion of insurance policyholder distributions. Expenses in 1995
reflected a decrease in payroll costs due to reduced staffing
levels and weather-related overtime offset by 1995 salary
increases and the impact of employees being reassigned from
capital to operation and maintenance activities. In addition,
1995 expenses include expenses associated with the North
Branch Power Station, increased obsolete inventory costs,
increased accruals for employee benefits, and increased
nuclear outage costs.

Nonutility
Nonutility Operating Results
The nonutility net income decreased in 1995 as compared
to 1994 because of the sale of the Black Warrior Trust units.
The sale of the units, which hold royalty interests in proven,
developed natural gas properties, provided a net gain of $28.9
million in the second quarter of 1994.
Dominion Resources also recorded $3.6 million in restruc-
turing expenses and $8.8 million in other charges in the fourth
quarter of 1995. These expenses included restructuring costs
at the holding company as well as litigation and other costs. All
outstanding shareholder claims that were made in 1994 have
been resolved.
WAT JY
Without restructuring costs, net income in 1995 would have
increased by $2.3 million and without other charges, net
income in 1995 would have increased by $5.8 million.
The nonutility companies increased net income in 1994
as compared to 1993 by 477% because of Dominion Energy's
sale of the Black Warrior Trust units.

Nonutility Operating Revenues
Nonutility revenues decreased in 1995 because of the sale
of the Black Warrior Trust units in 1994, partially offset by
revenues at Dominion Capital's financial services company,
First Source Financial, which began operating in April 1995.
The $8.3 million gain from the sale of the remaining Black
Warrior Trust units in 1995 also partially offset the decrease
in nonutility revenues.
The 1994 revenue increase was attributable to the sale
of the Black Warrior Trust units, partially offset by lower reve-
nues from the Vidalia hydroelectric plant when compared
with extraordinary water flows experienced in 1993.
Nonutility Operating Expenses
Operating expenses increased in 1995 because of restructur-
ing and other charges which were incurred by Dominion
Resources' holding company.
The increase in 1994 operating expenses was consistent
with revenue increases.23 Dominion Resources. Inc./1995 Annual Report
Consolidated Non-operating Items
Income Taxes
Income taxes increased in 1995 compared to 1994 primarily
because of decreases in nonconventional fuel credits and other
tax benefits. The nonutility companies recorded tax credits of
$33.0 million in 1995. They were primarily generated from
investments in low-income housing projects and natural gas
production activities.
Income taxes decreased in 1994 compared to 1993 primarily
because of decreased pre-tax book income from the utility.
This was partially offset by a tax increase from the nonutility
companies because of the sale of the Black Warrior Trust
units. The nonutility companies recorded tax credits of
$36,6 million in 1994.
Interest Charges
Interest charges increased in 1995 as compared to 1994
primarily as a result of higher interest rates on the utility's
First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds and Pollution Control
Notes and as a result of a reduction of $10.6 million in the inter-
est accrued for prior years on certain tax obligations in 1994.
Interest charges decreased in 1994 as compared to 1993 as a
result of the utility's reduction of $10.6 million in the interest
accrued for prior years on certain tax obligations, and the util-
ity's refinancing activities in current and prior years.
Future Issues
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In March 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," which
must be adopted by the company by January 1, 1996. This
statement requires the company to review long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable and requires rate-regulated companies to write off
regulatory assets against earnings whenever those assets no
longer meet the criteria for recognition of a regulatory asset as
defined by SFAS No. 71.
Based on the company's current operating environment,
adoption of SFAS 121 is not expected to have a material impact.
However, the Virginia Commission has established a proceed-
ing to examine the issue of competition and the regulatory
framework in Virginia. In addition, the Federal Energy Regula-
tory Commission (FERC) has initiated proceedings to address
open-access transmission policy. If future regulatory reform
should provide for a departure from cost-based regulation, reg-
ulators, electric utilities and other parties involved in the
restructuring of the electric industry would face significant
issues. One such issue is concerned with potential "stranded
investment." Stranded investment represents costs incurred or
commitments made by utilities under traditional cost-based
regulation based on an obligation to serve supported by an
implicit promise to recover prudently incurred costs that may
not be reasonably expected to be recovered. Regulatory assets
recognized under SFAS 71, unrecovered investment in power
plants and commitments such as long-term purchased power
contracts are items that may become stranded investment if
prices for electric services are based on market rather than
the cost of providing that service.
Virginia Power expects to continue to operate under regula-
tion and to recover its cost of providing traditional electric
service. However, the form of cost-based rate regulation,
under which Virginia Power operates, may evolve in the future
to accommodate changes in the industry and to address issues
such as recovery of potential stranded investment. At this
time, company management can predict neither the ultimate
outcome of the regulatory reform initiatives in the electric
utility industry nor the impact such changes would have on
the company.
In 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
SFAS No. 123 "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation."
The company has decided to continue to apply Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees," for recognition and measure-
ment purposes.
Utility issues
Regulatory Policy: Regulatory policy continues to be of funda-
mental importance to Virginia Power. The cost of purchased
capacity constitutes a large category of cost incurred in Vir-
ginia Power's operations. The Virginia Commission has
authorized rates providing for the current recovery of the
ongoing levels of capacity payments. Moreover, the Commis-
sion has established and reaffirmed deferral accounting that is
intended to ensure dollar for dollar recovery of reasonably
incurred capacity costs.
Competition: In light of existing and potential threats and
opportunities brought about by increased competition in the
wholesale and retail markets for electricity, Virginia Power has
undertaken cost-cutting measures to maintain its position as a
low-cost producer of electricity, engaged in re-engineering
efforts of its core business processes, and pursued a strategic
planning initiative called Vision 2000 to encourage innovative
approaches to serving traditional markets and to prepare
appropriate methods by which to service future markets. In
furtherance of these initiatives, Virginia Power has established
separate business units for its nuclear operations, fossil and
hydroelectric operations, commercial operations, as well as its
energy services business. It has gained regulatory approval of
innovative pricing proposals for industrial loads in Virginia
and North Carolina, entered into an energy partnership with a
key industrial customer, and in January 1996, acquired two
energy services divisions of A & C Enercom of Atlanta,
Georgia, which Virginia Power formed into a non-regulated
subsidiary, A & C Enercom, Inc.
As part of its Vision 2000 program, Virginia Power has
developed a regulatory/legislative strategy intended to estab-
lish an orderly transition to a more competitive environment.24 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report
It supports a number of legislative proposals that have been
introduced during the 1996 session of the Virginia General
Assembly that are aimed at achieving greater flexibility for
both the Virginia Commission and Virginia Power.
Virginia Power will continue to be affected by the develop-
ing competitive market in wholesale power. Under the Energy
Policy Act of 1992, any participant in the wholesale market can
obtain a FERC order to provide transmission services, under
certain conditions.
In 1995 a wholesale power group was formed within
Virginia Power to engage in the purchase and sale of whole-
sale electric power. The group has already developed trading
relationships beyond the geographic limits of Virginia Power's
rétail service territory.
In 1995, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NOPR) regarding open-access transmission service and a
NOPR regarding real-time information networks and stan-
dards of conduct. The real-time information network would
provide transmission users data concerning the availability of
transmission service on a same-time basis. Virginia Power
filed comments in both proceedings supporting FERC's objec-
tive to promote comparable open-access transmission service,
however, the company urged FERC to rethink its suggestion of
functional unbundling to insure the continued reliability of the
transmission system.
At present, competition for retail customers is limited. It
arises primarily from the ability of certain business customers
to relocate among utility service territories, to substitute other
energy sources for electric power and to generate their own
electricity. While the Energy Policy Act bans federal orders of
transmission service to ultimate customers, broader retail
competition that would allow customers to choose among elec-
tric suppliers is the subject of intense debate in legislative and
regulatory forums. If such competition were to develop, it
would have the potential to shift costs among customer classes
and to create significant transitional costs.
Potential competition also exists for Virginia Power's
sales to its wholesale cooperative and municipal customers.
However, nearly all of this service is under contracts with
multi-year notice provisions. To date, Virginia Power has not
experienced any material loss of load, revenues or net income
due to competition for its wholesale customers. The utility
believes it has a strong capability to meet future competition.
The City of Falls Church, Virginia, has indicated that it
intends to pursue the establishment of a municipal electric sys-
tem. In response to a Virginia Power petition, the Commission
has ruled that it has jurisdiction over the City and that the City
must seek approval from the Commission prior to implement-
ing plans to condemn Virginia Power facilities within the City.
Revenues from retail sales within the City of Falls Church
account for less than 0.2% of Virginia Power's total revenues.
As a result, Virginia Power will not experience a material loss
of revenues or net income should a municipal electric system
be created. No other city has communicated to Virginia Power
any interest in forming a municipal electric system.
In accordance with SFAS No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation," the company's financial
statements reflect assets and costs based on current cost-
based ratemaking regulations. Continued accounting under
SFAS No. 71 requires that the following criteria be met:
a) A utility's rates for regulated services provided to its
customers are established by, or are subject to approval
by, an independent third-party regulator;
b) The regulated rates are designed to recover specific
costs of providing the regulated services or products; and
c) In view of the demand for the regulated services and the
level of competition, direct and indirect, it is reasonable to
assume that rates set at levels that will recover a utility's
costs can be charged to and collected from customers. This
criterion requires consideration of anticipated changes in
levels of demand or competition during the recovery period
for any capitalized costs.
A utility's operations or portion of operations can cease
to meet these criteria for various reasons, including a change
in the method of regulation or a change in the competitive
environment for regulated services. A utility whose operations
or portion of operations cease to meet these criteria should
discontinue application of SFAS No. 71 and write off any
regulatory assets and liabilities for those operations that no
longer meet the requirements of SFAS No. 71. The company's
operations currently satisfy the SFAS No. 71 criteria. However,
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria
are no longer satisfied, management believes that a material
adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and
financial position may result.
Environmental Matters: Virginia Power is subject to rising
costs resulting from a steadily increasing number of federal,
state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human
health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect
future planning and existing operations. They can result in
increased capital, operating and other costs as a result of
compliance, remediation, containment, and monitoring obliga-
tions of Virginia Power. These costs have been historically
recovered through the ratemaking process; however, should
material costs be incurred and not recovered through rates,
Virginia Power's results of operations and financial condition
could be adversely impacted.
Virginia Power incurred expenses of $68.3 million, $67.3
million and $72.2 million (including depreciation) during 1995,
1994 and 1993, respectively, for environmental protection
facilities and expects these expenses to be approximately
$68.3 million in 1996. In addition, capital expenditures to limit
or monitor hazardous substances were $23.4 million, $47.3 mil-
lion and $94.4 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
The amount estimated for 1996 for these expenditures is
$24.5 million.
The Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires Virginia
Power to reduce its emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxides. Beginning in 1995, the sulfur dioxide reduction pro-
gram is based on the issuance of a limited number of sulfur
dioxide emission allowances, each of which may be used as a25 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report
permit to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere or
may be sold to someone else. The program is administered by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Virginia Power
has installed sulfur dioxide (SO2) control equipment on Unit 3
at Mt. Storm Power Station. The SO2 control equipment began
operation on October 31, 1994. The cost of this and related
equipment was $147 million. Virginia Power has completed its
compliance plan for Phase II of the Clean Air Act, with the
exception of some additional studies concerning Phase II
nitrogen oxide (NOx) controls. The plan will involve switching
to lower sulfur coal, purchase of emission allowances and addi-
tional NOx and SO2 controls. Maximum flexibility and least-
cost compliance will be maintained through annual studies.
Capital expenditures on Clean Air Act compliance over the
next 5 years are projected to be approximately $61 million.
Electromagnetic Flelds: The possibility that exposure to
electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emanating from power lines,
household appliances and other electric sources may result in
adverse health effects has been a subject of increased public,
governmental and media attention. A considerable amount of
scientific research has been conducted on this topic without
definitive results. Research is continuing to resolve scientific
uncertainties. It is too soon to tell what, if any, impact EMFs
may have on the company's financial condition.
Nuclear Operations: Three normal refueling outages are cur-
rently scheduled for 1996. Refueling outages typically occur
every 18 months and last for approximately 48 days. Virginia
Power's goal is to reduce refueling outages from an average of
48 days to 35 days. When nuclear units are refueled, Virginia
Power replaces the nuclear-generated power with other more
expensive sources. A reduction in the length of the outage
should result in increased availability of low-cost nuclear
generation, thereby lowering generation expenses.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission revised the nuclear
power plant license renewal rules issued in 1991. Virginia
Power intends to work with industry groups on license
renewal programs and to apply for renewal of the current
40-year licenses by 1999.
Nonutility Issues
Independent Power: The major emphasis in expanding
Dominion Energy's core independent power business is
international. With investments in Argentina, Bolivia and
Belize and growing interest elsewhere, the related risks
include currency fluctuations, developments in national mar-
kets, and governmental actions. Dominion Energy is
managing these risks by limiting its investments to stable
countries and by avoiding over-commitment to one country or
region. In the United States, the continuing industry trend
toward deregulation will offer opportunities to acquire exist-
ing assets.
Dominion Energy's U.S. independent power contracts
generally are not variable based on current market prices.
To date, none of the company's contractual purchasers have
sought to modify the terms of any of the company's indepen-
dent power contracts. If any of these contracts were to be
challenged and unfavorably modified there could be a signifi-
cant impact on the company's results of operations. Although,
r
in the future, there could be challenges to the enforceability of
these power sales contracts, management has evaluated all of
its significant independent power contracts and concluded that
the terms of such contracts are enforceable.
Natural Gas: Natural gas operations are now making a sig-
nificant contribution to Dominion Energy's earnings and are
expected to continue to do so. Since Dominion Energy has
acquired and developed primarily proven and/or producing
reserves, the trend of financial performance will depend
largely on the market price of natural gas. The market price
of any commodity is influenced by many factors outside of the
control of Dominion Energy. However, because of the advan-
tageous cost basis of Dominion Energy's reserves and the
related tax credits, the natural gas operations are profitable at
today's market prices. Since the majority of the reserves have
associated tax credits based on production, future profitability
could be impacted adversely by federal legislation that would
eliminate the tax credit before its current expiration in 2002.
Real Estate Investments: Dominion Capital's investments in
real estate have historically been a relatively minor part of the
nonutility business. Residential property development pri-
marily targets the middle- to upper-price market. The critical
risk to financial performance in this market is the regional
economy, which affects both market price and the rate at
which the market absorbs the developed product.
Commercial Lending: Dominion Capital's joint venture, First
Source Financial LLP, lends to middle-market companies. First
Source serves the nation's demand for loans to businesses
which need funds for expansion, recapitalization and acquisi-
tion. The critical risk to financial performance of First Source
is a decline in the general economy and competitive forces
affecting individual borrowers. This risk is reduced through a
policy of diversification of the lending portfolio. First Source
has assembled a proven management team, identified a spe-
cific market and established a strategic plan for growth in the
commercial lending arena.
Corporate Issues
Dominion Resources is unable to predict how changing indus-
try conditions may affect future results and that it is possible
that in order to address changing conditions in ways that are
designed to improve the ability of Dominion Resources and
Virginia Power to compete and to serve the goal of preserving
and enhancing shareholder value, it may be necessary to
effect structural changes either within Virginia Power or with
respect to the holding company structure.
During 1995, in a proceeding instituted by the Virginia
Commission in 1994 into the relationship between Dominion
Resources and Virginia Power, the Commission Staff filed a
Final Report, making numerous recommendations on corpo-
rate governance, intercompany relationships and regulatory
tools for the Commission. The Commission entered a consent
order, effective until July 2, 1996, requiring Commission
approval before Dominion Resources may take certain corpo-
rate actions involving Virginia Power. The two companies have
responded to the Final Report. The Staff's final response is
due March 15, 1996. Dominion Resources is unable to predict
the outcome of these matters.26 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Cash Flows and Financial Condition:
(Unaudited)
Consolidated
Financing Activity
Each of Dominion Resources' subsidiaries-Virginia, Power,
Dominion Capital, and Dominion Energy-obtains capital pri-
marily through cash from operations, financings and equity
contributed by the parent. The utility and nonutility com-
panies obtain financing based on their individual credit
profiles and ability to repay the debt. In no way are the other
companies contingently liable for each other's indebtedness.
Commercial Paper
To finance working capital for operations, proceeds from the
sale of Dominion Resources commercial paper in regional and
national markets are made available to its nonutility subsidi-
aries under the terms of intercompany credit agreements. To
support these borrowings, Dominion Resources had available
bank lines of credit totaling $300.8 million at the end of 1995.
Amounts borrowed by the subsidiaries are repaid to
Dominion Resources through cash flows from operations and
through proceeds from permanent financings.
Common Equity
Dominion Resources made no underwritten public offerings
of common stock in 1995, but did raise capital from sales of
common stock through an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment
and Stock Purchase Plan, a Customer Stock Purchase Plan,
and an Employee Savings Plan. Dominion Resources will con-
tinue to raise capital through these plans in 1996. Proceeds
from these plans were (in millions): 1995-$136.9; 1994-$166;
and 1993-$196.6. Reflected in the amounts of proceeds from
these plans were the repurchases of 685,500 shares of com-
mon stock in 1995 for an aggregate price of $24.8 million, and
566,000 shares in 1994 for an aggregate price of $20,7 million.
Dominion Resources is authorized to repurchase up to 5 mil-
lion shares of its common stock.
Virginia Power
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity is important to Virginia Power because of the
capital intensive nature of its business, which requires large
investments in long-lived assets. Cash from operations has
accounted for, on average, 72 percent of Virginia Power's cash
requirements during the past three years. Virginia Power's
major external sources of financing during 1995 were the
issuances of $200 million of First and Refunding Mortgage
Bonds, $135 million of preferred securities of a subsidiary
trust, and $40 million of unsecured medium term notes. The
proceeds from these financings were used for redemptions of
various series of Dividend Preferred Stock having an aggre-
gate principal value of $126.7 million, and payment of a portion
of Virginia Power's mandatory debt maturities and capital
requirements. During the year, Virginia Power retired $312.3
million of securities through mandatory debt maturities.

These transactions, among other factors, had the effect of rais-
ing Virginia Power's embedded cost of debt from 7.65 percent
to 773 percent in 1995.
Virginia Power's common equity portion of its capitaliza.
tion was 43.8 percent at December 31, 1995.
Virginia Power's commercial paper program is supported
by a $300 million revolving credit facility. The program's debt
limit is $300 million. Proceeds from the sale of commercial
paper are primarily used to finance working capital for opera-
tions. Net borrowings under the commercial paper program
were $169 million at the end of 1995.
In 1995, Virginia Power paid common stock and preferred
stock dividends of $394.3 million and $44.3 million,
respectively.
Capital Requirements
Virginia Power presently anticipates that kilowatt-hour sales
will grow approximately two percent a year through 2010..
Capacity needed to support this growth will be provided
through a combination of generating units constructed by
Virginia Power and purchases from nonutility generators and
other utility generators. Each of these options plays an impor-
tant role in Virginia Power's overall plan to meet capacity
needs. After 1996, no new base load generation is expected to
be needed until the end of the next decade. From 2000 until
2009, Virginia Power will need to add peaking or intermediate
units to meet anticipated demand.30 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report

Construction continues on the Clover project in which
Virginia Power has a 50 percent ownership interest.
Virginia Power's share of construction costs is estimated
to be $514,7 million. As of December 31, 1995, Virginia Power
had incurred $500.7 million in construction expenditures.
Clover Unit 1 began commercial operation in October 1995
and Clover Unit 2 is expected to be in service by April 1996.
In 1995, with the near completion of the 832 megawatt coal-
fired power station near Clover, Virginia, Virginia Power began
a period in which internal cash generation will exceed con-
struction expenditures.
The internal generation of cash in 1994 and 1993 provided
88 percent and 84 percent, respectively, of the funds required
for Virginia Power's capital requirements.
Virginia Power will require $259.6 million to meet long-term
debt maturities in 1996. Virginia Power presently estimates
that, for 1996, all of its construction expenditures, including
nuclear fuel expenditures, will be met through cash flow from
operations. Other capital requirements will be met through a
combination of sales of securities and short-term borrowings.
Projected construction and nuclear fuel expenditures
for the next three years are expected to total approximately
$1.6 billion, including allowance for funds used during
construction (AFC).
Nonutility
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Current capital requirements for nonutility operations are
funded from: internally generated funds; intercompany
credit agreements with Dominion Resources; a $200 million
medium-term note facility; $185 million in bank revolving
credit agreements and a $90 million commercial paper pro-
gram. In 1995, net borrowings decreased by $121.5 million,
primarily due to the cash inflow from the equity contributions
of Dominion Resources. In 1994, net borrowings decreased
by $33.7 million, primarily due to the cash inflow from
the sale of the Black Warrior Trust units. Net borrowings
increased by $264.2 million during 1993. These funds were
borrowed principally for investments in marketable securities,
natural gas acquisitions, land acquisitions and independent
power projects.

Note Significant Accounting Policies
A
General: Dominion Resources, Inc. is a holding company
headquartered in Richmond, Virginia. Its primary business
is Virginia Electric and Power Company, which is a regulated
public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, dis-
tribution and sale of electric energy within a 30,000 square
mile area in Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. It
sells electricity to retail customers (including governmental
agencies) and to wholesale customers such as rural electric
cooperatives and municipalities. The Virginia service area
comprises about 65 percent of Virginia's total land area, but
accounts for over 80 percent of its population.
The company also operates business subsidiaries active in
independent power production; the acquisition and sale of nat-
ural gas reserves; in financial services, and in real estate.
Some of the independent power and natural gas projects are
located in foreign countries. Net assets of approximately $200
million are involved in independent power produ opera-
tions in Latin America,
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Dominion Resources is currently exempt from regulation
as a registered holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.
Accounting for the utility business conforms with generally
accepted accounting principles as applied to regulated public
utilities and as prescribed by federal agencies and the com-
missions of the states in which the utility business operates.
Consolidation: The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of Dominion Resources and its subsidi-
aries. In consolidation, all significant inter-company trans-
actions and accounts have been eliminated.
Operating Revenues and Income: Utility revenues are
recorded on the basis of service rendered. Dividend income
on securities owned is recognized on the ex-dividend date.
Investments in common stocks of affiliates representing
20 percent to 50 percent ownership, and joint ventures and
partnerships representing generally 50 percent or less owner-
ship interests, are accounted for under the equity method.
Property, Plant and Equipment: Utility plant is recorded at
original cost, which includes labor, materials, services, AFC
(where permitted by regulators), and other indirect costs.
The cost of acquisition, exploration and development
of natural resource properties is accounted for under the
successful efforts method.
Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction
of major facilities. The capitalized interest is recorded as
part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the
asset's estimated useful life. In 1995, 1994 and 1993, $14.1 mil-
lion, $13.8 million, and $11.1 million of interest cost was
capitalized, respectively. Capitalized interest includes AFC-
other funds for certain regulatory jurisdictions of $6.7 million,
$6.4 million and $5.1 million for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization: Depreciation of utility
plant (other than nuclear fuel) is computed using the straight-
line method based on projected useful service lives. The cost
of depreciable utility plant retired and the cost of removal, less
salvage, are charged to accumulated depreciation. The
sion for depreciation on utility plant was based on weighted
average depreciable plant using a rate of 3.2 percent for 1995,
1994, and 1993.

Owned nuclear fuel is amortized on a unit-of-production
basis sufficient to amortize fully, over the estimated
service life, the cost of the fuel plus permanent storage and
disposal costs.
Costs in excess of net assets acquired from equity invest-
ments are amortized over periods not to exceed 40 years.
Nuclear Decommissioning: Nuclear plant decommissioning
costs are accrued and recovered through rates over the
expected service lives of inia Power's nuclear generating
units. The amounts collected from customers are being placed
in trusts, which, with the accumulated earnings thereon, will
be utilized solely to fund future decommissioning obligations.

Approximately every four years, site-specific studies are
prepared to determine the decommissioning cost estimate for
Virginia Power's four nuclear units. The current cost estimate
is based on the DECON method, which assumes the activities
associated with the decontamination or prompt removal of
radioactive contaminants will begin shortly after cessation of
operations so that the property may be released for unre-
stricted use.
The accumulated provision for decommissioning of
$351.4 million and $260.9 million is included in accumulated
depreciation, depletion and amortization at December 31, 1995
and 1994, respectively. Provisions for decommissioning of
$28.5 million, $24.5 million and $24.4 million applicable to
1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, are included in depreciation,
depletion and amortization expense. The net unrealized
gain of $40.7 million and a net unrealized loss of $5.2 million
associated with securities held by Virginia Power's Nuclear
Decommissioning trust at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, are included in the accumulated provision for
decommissioning.
Earnings of the trust funds were $15.9 million, $15.2 million
and $16.3 million for 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, and are
included in other income in the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
The accretion of the accumulated provision for decom-
missioning, equal to the earnings of the trust funds, is also
recorded in other income.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is
reviewing the accounting for nuclear plant decommissioning.
If current electric utility industry practices for such decom-
missioning are changed, annual provisions for decommission-
ing could increase. FASB has tentatively determined that
estimated cost of decommissioning should be reported as
a liability rather than as accumulated depreciation and that a
substantial portion of the decommissioning obligation should
be recognized earlier in the operating life of the nuclear plant.
During its deliberations, FASB has expanded the scope of
this project to include similar unavoidable obligations to per-
form closure and post-closure activities incurred as a condition
to operate assets other than nuclear power plants. Whether
this position, if adopted, would impact other assets of Virginia
Power cannot be determined at this time. Furthermore, the
FASB has tentatively determined that it would be inappropriate
to account for cost of removal as negative salvage; thus, any
forthcoming standard may also cause changes in industry
plant depreciation practices.
Federal Income Taxes: Dominion Resources and its subsidi-
aries file a consolidated federal income tax return.
Dominion Resources adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes" in 1992 which requires companies to
measure and record deferred tax assets and liabilities for all
temporary differences. Temporary differences occur when
events and transactions recognized for financial reporting
result in taxable or tax-deductible amounts in future periods.
The regulatory treatment of temporary differences can differ
from the requirements of SFAS No. 109. Accordingly, Virginia
Power recognizes a regulatory asset if it is probable that future
revenues will be provided for the payment of those deferred
tax liabilities. Similarly, in the event a deferred tax liability is
reduced to reflect changes in tax rates, a regulatory liability is
established if it is probable that a future reduction in revenue
will result.
Due to regulatory requirements, Virginia Power accounts
for investment tax credits under the "deferral method" which
provides for the amortization of these credits over the service
lives of the property giving rise to the credits.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction: The applicable
regulatory Uniform System of Accounts defines AFC as the
cost during the construction period of borrowed funds used
for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other
funds when so used.
The pre-tax AFC rates for 1995, 1994 and 1993 were 8.9,
8.9 and 9.4 percent, respectively. Approximately 83 percent
of Virginia Power's construction work in progress (CWIP) is
now included in rate base and a cash return is collected cur-
rently thereon.
Deferred Capacity and Fuel Expenses: Approximately 90 per-
cent of fuel expenses and 80 percent of capacity expenses are
subject to deferral accounting. Under this method, the differ-
ence between reasonably incurred actual expenses and the
level of expenses included in current rates is deferred and
matched against future revenues.
Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs: Dominion Resources
defers and amortizes any expenses incurred in the issuance of
long-term debt including premiums and discounts associated
with such debt over the lives of the respective issues. Any
gains or losses resulting from the refinancing of Virginia
Power debt are also deferred and amortized over the lives of
the new issues of long-term debt as permitted by the appropri-
ate regulatory commission. At Virginia Power, gains or losses
resulting from the redemption of debt without refinancing are
amortized over the remaining lives of the redeemed issues.
Marketable Securitles: Dominion Resources adopted, effec-
tive January 1, 1994, SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The standard
requires companies to account for and classify investments in
equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and
for all investments in debt securities based on management's
intent. The investments are to be classified into three catego-
ries and accounted for in the following manner.
Debt securities which are intended to be held to maturity
are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at
amortized cost. Debt and equity securities purchased and held
with the intent of selling them in the current period are classi-
fied as trading securities. They are reported at fair value and
unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. Debt and33 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report
equity securities that are neither held-to-maturity or trading
are classified as available-for-sale securities. These are
reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses
reported in shareholders' equity, net of tax.
This standard is to be applied on a prospective basis effec-
tive with fiscal years after December 15, 1993 and can not be
applied retroactively to the prior year's financial statements.
Nonrecourse-Nonutillty Financings: Dominion Resources' non-
utility subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations and
obtain financings that generally are secured by the assets
of the nonutility subsidiaries. However, Dominion Resources
may be required to provide contingent equity support or to
maintain a minimum net worth at the nonutility subsidiaries.
These financings have been segregated on the accompanying
financial statements to distinguish their nonrecourse nature.
Cash: Current banking arrangements generally do not
require checks to be funded until actually presented for
payment. At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the company's
accounts payable included the net effect of checks outstand-
ing but not yet presented for payment of $70.1 million and
$72.2 million, respectively.
For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows, Dominion Resources considers cash and cash equiva-
lents to include cash on hand and temporary investments
purchased with a maturity of three months or less.

Reclassification: Certain amounts in the 1994 and 1993 Consoli-
dated Financial Statements have been reclassified to conform
to the 1995 presentation.
Virginia Power has an agreement to sell, with limited recourse,
certain accounts receivable including unbilled amounts, up
to a maximum of $200 million. Additional receivables are con-
tinually sold, at Virginia Power's discretion, to replace those
collected up to the limit. At December 31, 1995 no amount
was outstanding; however, at December 31, 1994, $160 mil-
lion of receivables had been sold and were outstanding under
this agreement. The limited recourse is provided by Virginia
Power's assignment of an additional undivided interest in
accounts receivable to cover any potential losses to the
purchaser due to uncollectible accounts. Virginia Power
has provided for the estimated amount of such losses
in its accounts.

Income taxes recoverable through future rates represent
principally the tax effect of depreciation differences not nor-
malized. These amounts are amortized as the related
temporary differences reverse.
The costs of decommissioning Department of Energy's
(DOE) uranium enrichment facilities have been deferred
and represent the unamortized portion of Virginia Power's
required contributions to a fund for decommissioning and
decontaminating the DOE's uranium enrichment facilities.
Virginia Power is making such contributions over a 15-year
period with escalation for inflation. These costs are being
recovered in fuel rates.
Losses or gains on reacquired debt are deferred and amor-.
tized over the lives of the new issues of long-term debt. Gains
or losses resulting from the redemption of debt without refi-
nancing are amortized over the remaining lives of the
redeemed issues.
The construction of North Anna 3 was terminated in
November 1982. All retail jurisdictions have permitted recov-
ery of the incurred costs. For Virginia and FERC jurisdictional
customers, the amounts deferred are being amortized from
the date termination costs were first includible in rates.
The incurred costs underlying these regulatory assets may
represent expenditures by Virginia Power or may represent
the recognition of liabilities that ultimately will be settled at
some time in the future. For some of those regulatory assets
representing past expenditures that are not included in
Virginia Power's rate base or used to adjust Virginia Power's
capital structure, Virginia Power is not allowed to earn a return
on the unrecovered balance. Of the $816.4 million of regula-
tory assets at December 31, 1995, approximately $123 million
represent past expenditures that are effectively excluded from
the rate base by the Virginia State Corporation Commission
that has primary jurisdiction over Virginia Power's rates. How-
ever, of that amount $101.8 million represent the present value
of amounts to be recovered through future rates for North
Anna Unit 3 project termination costs, and thus reflect a reduc-
tion in the actual dollars to be recovered through future rates
for the time value of money. Virginia Power does not earn a
return on the remaining $21.2 million of regulatory assets,
effectively excluded from rate base, to be recovered over vari-
ous recovery periods up to 23 years, depending on the nature
of the deferred costs.

For the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1994, the proceeds
from the sales of available-for-sale securities were $494 million
and $35.8 million, respectively. The gross realized gains and
losses were $10.4 million and $0.1 million for 1995 and
$0.4 million and $1.6 million for 1994, respectively. The basis on
which the cost of these securities was determined is specific
identification. For 1994, the gross gains included in earnings
from transfers of securities from the available-for-sale cate-
gory into the trading category was $0.8 million. The changes
in net unrealized holding gain or loss on available-for-sale
securities has resulted in an increase in the separate compo-
nent of shareholders equity during the year ended December
31, 1995 of $41.1 million, net of tax, and a decrease of $47.2 mil-
lion, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 1994. The
changes in net realized holding gain or loss on trading securi-
ties increased earnings during the year ended December 31,
1995 by $2.1 million and decreased earnings by $10 million for
the year ended December 31, 1994.

In 1993, the company accounted for marketable securities
as prescribed in SFAS No. 12, "Accounting for Certain Mar-
ketable Securities." A net realized gain of $12.5 million on the
sale of marketable securities was included in net income for
the year ended December 31, 1993.36 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report

Virginia Power is recovering these costs in rates on an accrual
basis in all material respects, in all jurisdictions. Current
and future rate recoveries of OPEB accruals are expected to
collect sufficient amounts to provide for the unfunded accumu-
lated postretirement obligation over time.
The funds being collected for OPEB accrual in rates, in
excess of OPEB benefits actually paid during the year, are
contributed to external benefit trusts under Virginia Power's
current funding policy.
Other Benefits: In 1994, Virginia Power offered an early
retirement program to employees aged 50 or older and offered
a voluntary separation program to all regular full-time
employees. Approximately 1,400 employees accepted offers
under these programs. The costs associated with these pro-
grams were $90.1 million. Virginia Power capitalized $25.9

In March 1995, Virginia Power announced the implementation
phase of its Vision 2000 program. During this phase, Virginia
Power began reviewing operations with the objective of out-
sourcing services where economical and appropriate, and re-
engineering the remaining functions to streamline operations.
The re-engineering process is resulting in outsourcing,
decentralization, reorganization and downsizing for portions of
Virginia Power's operations. As part of this process, Virginia
Power is reevaluating its utilization of capital resources in its
operations to identify further opportunities for operational effi-
ciencies through outsourcing or re-engineering of its
processes.
In 1995, restructuring charges of $121.5 million contain
$117.9 million of Virginia Power's restructuring charges which
included severance costs, purchased power contract cancella-
tion and negotiated settlement costs, capital project cancel-
lation costs, and other costs incurred directly as a result of the
Vision 2000 initiatives. The Vision 2000 review of operations is
expected to continue through 1996. At this time, Virginia
Power management cannot estimate the restructuring costs
yet to be incurred.
In May 1995, Virginia Power established a comprehensive
involuntary severance package for salaried employees who
lose their positions as a result of these initiatives. Virginia
Power is recognizing the cost associated with employee termi-
nations in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
Consensus No. 94-3 as management identifies the positions to
be eliminated. Severance payments will be made over a period
not to exceed twenty months. Through December 31, 1995,
management had decided to eliminate 1,018 positions. The
recognition of severance costs resulted in a charge to opera-
tions in 1995 of $51.2 million. At December 31, 1995, 507
employees have been terminated and severance payments
totaling $8.7 million have been paid. Virginia Power estimates
that these staffing reductions will result in annual savings, net
of outsourcing costs, in the range of $50 million to $60 million.
These savings will be reflected in lower construction expendi-
tures as well as lower operation and maintenance expenses.
In an effort to minimize its exposure to potential stranded
investment, Virginia Power is evaluating its long-term pur-
chased power contracts and negotiating modifications to their
terms, including cancellations, where it is determined to be42 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report
economically advantageous to do so. Virginia Power also nego-
tiated settlements with several other parties to terminate their
rights to sell power to Virginia Power. The cost of contract can-
cellations and negotiated settlements was $8.1 million in 1995.
Based on contract terms and estimated quantities of power
that would have otherwise been delivered, the cancellation of
these contracts and rights to sell power to Virginia Power has
the effect of reducing Virginia Power's future purchased
power costs, including energy payments, by up to $214 mil-
lion annually. The cost of alternative sources of power that
might ultimately be required as a result of these settlements
are expected to be significantly less than $214 million.
Restructuring charges reported in 1995 included $37.3 mil-
lion for the cancellation of a project to construct a facility to
handle low level radioactive waste at Virginia Power's North
Anna Power Station. As a result of reevaluating the handling of
low level radioactive waste, Virginia Power concluded that the
facility should not be completed due to the additional capital
investment required, decreased Virginia Power volumes
of low level radioactive waste resulting from improvements
in station procedures and the availability of more economical
offsite processing.
As a regulated utility, Virginia Power provides service to its
customers at rates based on its cost of operations and an
opportunity to earn a return on its shareholder's investment.
From time to time, Virginia Power reviews its cost of providing
regulated services and files such information with certain
regulatory commissions having jurisdiction. Virginia Power
or the regulatory commissions may initiate proceedings to
review rates charged to Virginia Power jurisdictional custom-
ers. The incurrence of restructuring charges and the savings
resulting therefrom in subsequent periods are elements of
Virginia Power's cost of operations. Accordingly, Vision 2000
costs and related savings will be considered in any future
review of Virginia Power's overall regulatory cost of service.
Note Commitments and Contingencies
P
As the result of issues generated in the course of daily busi-
ness, the company is involved in legal, tax and regulatory
proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions
and governmental agencies. While some of the proceedings
involve substantial amounts of money, management believes
that the final disposition of these proceedings will not have an
adverse material effect on operations or the financial position
of the company.
Virginia Power
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Audit: The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) has recently conducted a
compliance audit of Virginia Power's financial statements for
the years 1990 to 1994. Virginia Power has received a pre-
liminary draft of the audit report in which certain compliance
exceptions were noted. Virginia Power has supplied informa-
tion to the FERC staff relating to these preliminary exceptions,
but no final audit report has been issued. Based on information
available at this time, the disposition of these issues is not
expected to have a significant effect on Virginia Power's finan-
cial position or results of operations.
Construction Program: Virginia Power has made substantial
commitments in connection with its construction program
and nuclear fuel expenditures, which are estimated to total
$569,3 million (excluding AFC) for 1996. Additional financing
is contemplated in connection with this program.
Purchased Power Contracts: Since 1984, Virginia Power has
entered into contracts for the long-term purchase of capacity
and energy from other utilities, qualifying facilities and inde-
pendent power producers. As of December 31, 1995, there
were 67 nonutility generating facilities under contract to pro-
vide Virginia Power 3,493 megawatts of dependable summer
capacity. Of these, 66 projects (aggregating 3,295 megawatts)
were operational at the end of 1995, with the remaining project
to become operational before 1998. The following table shows
the minimum payments expected to be made under these con-
tracts. The totals include payments for capacity, which are
subject to generating performance as provided by the con-
tracts, and payments for the minimum amounts of energy
Virginia Power is obligated to buy and the producers provide.

In addition to the commitments listed above, under some con-
tracts, Virginia Power may purchase, at its option, additional
power as needed. Payments for purchased power (including
economy, emergency, limited-term, short-term, and long-term
purchases) for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993 were $1,093 mil-
lion, $1,025 million and $958 million, respectively.
Fuel Purchase Commitments: Virginia Power's estimated fuel
purchase commitments for the next five years for system
generation are as follows: 1996-$348 million; 1997-$319 mil-
lion; 1998-$205 million; 1999-$137 million; and 2000-
$151 million.
Environmental Matters: Environmental costs have been his-
torically recovered through the ratemaking process; however,
should material costs be incurred and not recovered through
rates, Virginia Power's results of operations and financial.
condition could be adversely impacted.
The EPA has identified Virginia Power and several other
entities as Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at two
Superfund sites located in Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The
estimated future remediation costs for the sites are in the
range of $46.5 million to $134.6 million. Virginia Power's pro-
portionate share of the costs is expected to be in the range of
$0.5 million to $6,7 million, based upon allocation formulas and
the volume of waste shipped to the sites. As of December 31,
1995, Virginia Power accrued a reserve of $1.4 million to meet
its obligations at these two sites.
Based on a financial assessment of the PRPs involved at
these sites, Virginia Power has determined that it is probable
that the PRPs will fully pay the costs apportioned to them.
Virginia Power and Dominion Resources along with
Consolidated Natural Gas have remedial action responsi-
bilities remaining at two coal tar sites. Virginia Power and
Dominion Resources have accrued a $2 million reserve
to meet their estimated liability based on site studies and
investigations performed at these sites. In addition, on Decem-
ber 13, 1995, a civil action was instituted against the City of
Norfolk and Virginia Power by a landowner who alleges that
his property has been contaminated by toxic pollutants orig-
inating from one of these sites, which is now owned by the
City of Norfolk. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages of
$10 million and punitive damages of $5 million from Virginia
Power. The Company filed its answer denying liability on Janu-
ary 10, 1996.
Virginia Power generally seeks to recover its costs asso-
ciated with environmental remediation from third party
insurers. At December 31, 1995 pending claims were not
recognized as an asset or offset against recorded obligations.
Nuclear Insurance: The Price-Anderson Act limits the public
liability of an owner of a nuclear power plant to $8.9 billion for
a single nuclear incident. The Price Anderson Amendments
Act of 1988 allows for an inflationary provision adjustment
every five years. Virginia Power has purchased $200 million
of coverage from commercial insurance pools with the
remainder provided through a mandatory industry risk-
sharing program. In the event of a nuclear incident at any
licensed nuclear reactor in the United States, Virginia Power
could be assessed up to $81.7 million (including a 3 percent
insurance premium tax for Virginia) for each of its four
licensed reactors not to exceed $10.3 million (including a 3 per-
cent insurance premium tax for Virginia) per year per reactor.
There is no limit to the number of incidents for which this
retrospective premium can be assessed.
Nuclear liability coverage for claims made by nuclear work-
ers first hired on or after January 1, 1988, except those arising
out of an extraordinary nuclear occurrence, is provided under
the Master Worker insurance program. (Those first hired into
the nuclear industry prior to January 1, 1988 are covered by
the policy discussed above.) The aggregate limit of coverage
for the industry is $400 million ($200 million policy limit
with automatic reinstatements of an additional $200 million).
Virginia Power's maximum retrospective assessment is
approximately $12.5 million (including a 3 percent insurance
premium tax for Virginia).
Virginia Power's current level of property insurance cover-
age ($2.55 billion for North Anna and $2.4 billion for Surry)
exceeds the NRC's minimum requirement for nuclear power
plant licensees of $1.06 billion per reactor site, and includes
coverage for premature decommissioning and functional total44 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report]
. . . - -
loss. The NRC requires that the proceeds from this insurance
be used first to return the reactor to and maintain it in a safe
and stable condition, and second to decontaminate the reactor
and station site in accordance with a plan approved by the
NRC. Virginia Power's nuclear property insurance is provided
by Nuclear Mutual Limited (NML) and Nuclear Electric Insur-
ance Limited (NEIL), two mutual insurance companies, and
is subject to retrospective premium assessments in any policy
year in which losses exceed the funds available to these
insurance companies. The maximum assessment at the first
incident of the current policy period is $42.7 million. The
maximum assessment related to a second incident is an addi-
tional $15.4 million. Based on the severity of the incident,
the boards of directors of Virginia Power's nuclear insurers
have the discretion to lower the maximum retrospective
premium assessment or eliminate either or both completely.
For any losses that exceed the limits, or for which insurance
proceeds are not available because they must first be used
for stabilization and decontamination, Virginia Power has the
financial responsibility.
Virginia Power purchases insurance from NEIL to cover
the cost of replacement power during the prolonged outage
of a nuclear unit due to direct physical damage of the unit.
Under this program, Virginia Power is subject to a retrospec-
tive premium assessment for any policy year in which losses
exceed funds available to NEIL. The current policy period's
maximum assessment is $9 million.
As a joint owner of the North Anna Power Station, ODEC
is responsible for its proportionate share (11.6 percent) of
the insurance premiums applicable to that station, including
any retrospective premium assessments and any losses not
covered by insurance.
Dominion Resources
Under the terms of an investment agreement, Dominion
Resources must provide contingent equity support to
Dominion Energy in the amount of $56.5 million. Management
believes the possibility of such support to Dominion Energy
is remote.
Dominion Energy
Dominion Energy has general partnership interests in certain
of its energy ventures. Accordingly, Dominion Energy may be
called upon to fund future operation of these investments to
the extent operating cash flow is insufficient.

As part of the Vision 2000 program (see Note O), Virginia
Power recorded $117.9 million of restructuring charges in
1995. Restructuring charges included severance costs, pur-
chase power contract cancellation and negotiated settlement
costs, capital project cancellation costs, and other costs
incurred directly as a result of the Vision 2000 initiatives. Vir-
ginia Power expensed $3.5 million, $1.8 million, $30.6 million
and $82 million during the first, second, third and fourth quar-
ters, respectively. The impact of the write-off reduced net
income by $2.3 million, $1.1 million, $19.9 million and $53.3
million for the first, second, third, and fourth quarters,
respectively.
In the fourth quarter of 1995, Dominion Resources incurred
at the holding company restructuring expenses amounting to
$3.6 million and other charges amounting to $8.8 million. The
other charges included litigation costs which were incurred to
resolve the shareholder claims made in 1994. The impact of
the restructuring expenses reduced net income by $2.3 mil-
lion and the other charges reduced net income by $5.8 million.
During December 1995, Dominion Energy settled certain
outstanding disputes with a supplier and renegotiated the
terms of related long term supply contracts. As a result, the
fourth quarter earnings include gains from these changes
which total $6.2 million, net of tax.
In June 1995, Dominion Resources Black Warrior Trust
units were sold to third parties amounting to a gain of $5.4 mil-
lion, net of tax. These were the remaining ownership units of a
trust established in June 1994 when Dominion Energy trans-
ferred from Dominion Black Warrior Basin to Dominion
Resources Black Warrior Trust a 65 percent overriding royalty
interest in coal seam gas properties.
In 1994, Virginia Power offered an early retirement pro-
gram to employees aged 50 or older and offered a voluntary
separation program to all regular full-time employees. Approx-
imately 1,400 employees accepted offers under these
programs. The costs associated with these programs were
$90.1 million, Virginia Power capitalized $25.9 million to con-
struction work in progress based upon regulatory precedent
and expensed $2.8 million, $10.4 million and $51 million during ·
the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. The impact
of the write-off was to reduce net income by $1.8 million, $6.7
million and $33.1 million for the second, third and fourth quar-
ters, respectively.
On June 28, 1994, Dominion Energy transferred a 65% over-
riding royalty interest in coal seam gas properties then owned
by Dominion Black Warrior Basin, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Dominion Energy, to Dominion Resources Black Warrior
Trust, which is sponsored by Dominion Resources. Units
in the trust were sold in the second quarter to third parties,
culminating in a gain of $28.9 million, net of tax. Total federal
and state taxes for this transaction amounted to $20.1 million.46 Dominion Resources, Inc./1995 Annual Report
Report of Management's Responsibilities
he management of Dominion Resources, Inc. is responsible for all information
other sections of the annual report. The Consolidated Financial Statements, which
include amounts based on estimates and judgments of management, have been
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Other finan-
cial information in the annual report is consistent with that in the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Management maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed
to provide reasonable assurance, at a reasonable cost, that Dominion Resources'
and its subsidiaries' assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use
or disposition and that transactions are executed and recorded in accordance
with established procedures. Management recognizes the inherent limitations of
any system of internal accounting control, and therefore cannot provide absolute
assurance that the objectives of the established internal accounting controls
will be met.
This system includes written policies, an organizational structure designed to
ensure appropriate segregation of responsibilities, careful selection and training
of qualified personnel, and internal audits. Management believes that during 1995
the system of internal control was adequate to accomplish the intended objectives.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte &
Touche LLP, independent auditors, whose designation by the Board of Directors
was ratified by the shareholders. Their audits were conducted in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards and include a review of Dominion
Resources' and its subsidiaries' accounting systems, procedures and internal con-
trols, and the performance of tests and other auditing procedures sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance that the Consolidated Financial Statements are not
materially misleading and do not contain material errors.
The Audit Committees of the Boards of Directors, composed entirely of direc-
tors who are not officers or employees of Dominion Resources or its subsidiaries,
meet periodically with independent auditors, the internal auditors and manage-
ment to discuss auditing, internal accounting control and financial reporting mat-
ters and to ensure that each is properly discharged. Both independent auditors
and the internal auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committees and
have free access to the Committees at any time.
Management recognizes its responsibility for fostering a strong ethical climate
so that Dominion Resources' affairs are conducted according to the highest stan-
dards of personal corporate conduct. This responsibility is characterized and
reflected in Dominion Resources' Code of Ethics, which addresses potential con-
flicts of interest, compliance with all domestic and foreign laws, the confidentiality
of proprietary information, and full disclosure of public information.

Report of Independent Auditors
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Dominion Resources, Inc.
Te have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dominion
the related consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995. These
Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the company's manage-
ment. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these Consolidated Financial
Statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Dominion Resources, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1994 and the results of their opera-
tions and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended Decem-
ber 31, 1995 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Dominion Resources provides holders of common stock a

ically paid on the 20th day of March, June, September and

Address Changes
It is important that we have your current address on file so that
you do not become a "lost" shareholder. Please contact Share-
holder Administration promptly with any address changes.
Beneficial Owners
When you purchase stock and it is held for you by your broker,
it may be listed with the company in the broker's name, also
known as the "street name." This qualifies you as a beneficial
owner. If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive all divi-
dend payments, annual reports and proxy materials through
your broker.Transfer Agent and Registrar

Consolidating Multiple Accounts
Multiple accounts for shareholders exist when:
-A shareholder owns stock in variations of the same name
(for example, John E. Smith and John Edward Smith), or
-A shareholder owns stock in his or her name alone but also
owns stock with another shareholder.
When such multiple accounts exist, the company is required
by law to create a separate account for each name and to
mail separate dividend checks and proxy material for each
account. To consolidate any multiple accounts, please contact
Dominion Resources for instructions.
Sale or issuance of stock
If you want to sell certificate shares of Dominion Resources
common stock, you must provide the stock certificates and a
Letter of Transmittal and Sale of Shares Request card, which
we will provide. Or you may write a letter of instruction listing
the certificate numbers and requesting sale of the shares. All
owners must have their signatures medallion guaranteed on
the Letter of Transmittal or personal letter.
Another option would be to take the certificates to a
stockbroker to sell for you.
To sell shares held in the dividend reinvestment plan or to
have stock certificates issued, you must provide written
instructions. To expedite these transactions, please use the
"Authorization Form" attached to your quarterly statement
and the envelope enclosed with your statement.
We cannot take requests to sell shares or issue certificates
over the phone.
Custodial Deposit of Certificate Shares
Participants in the dividend reinvestment plan may send cer-
tificate shares for safekeeping, which offers the advantage of
protection against loss, theft or inadvertent destruction of
certificates as well as convenience if and when the shares
are sold through the plan.
To deposit your certificates for safekeeping under the plan,
you must submit the certificates and a Letter of Transmittal,
which will be provided to you upon request, to Shareholder
Administration. Or you may write a letter asking us to deposit
your certificate shares. Whether you use a Letter of Transmit-
tal or write your own letter, all owners must sign the letter and
have their signatures medallion guaranteed. Please do not sign
the certificates.
